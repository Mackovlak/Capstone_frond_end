It is rare for a solitary actinic keratosis to evolve to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but the risk of SCC occurring at some stage in a patient with more than 10 actinic keratoses is thought to be about 10 to 15%. A tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratosis is suspicious of evolution to SCC.\n\nCutaneous horn may arise from an underlying actinic keratosis or SCC.\n\nBecause they are sun damaged, people with actinic keratoses are also at risk of developing actinic cheilitis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC, which is more common than SCC), melanoma, and rare forms of skin cancer such as Merkel cell carcinoma.\n\n"

The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of invasive squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nTreatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells. Epidermis regenerates from surrounding or follicular keratinocytes that have escaped sun damage.\nSome AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens.\n\nTender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation.\n\n"

The lesions may recur in time, in which case they may be retreated by the same or a different method.\n\nLiquid nitrogen spray is required to achieve adequate depth and duration of the freeze. This varies according to lesion location, width, and thickness. Healing varies from 5–10 days on the face, 3–4 weeks on the hands, and 6 weeks or longer on the legs. A light freeze for a superficial actinic keratosis usually leaves no mark, but longer freeze times result in hypopigmentation or scar.\n\nShave, curettage (scraping with a sharp instrument) and electrocautery (burning) may be necessary to remove a cutaneous horn or hypertrophic actinic keratosis. Healing of the wound takes several weeks or longer, depending on the body site. The specimen is sent for histological examination.\n\nExcision ensures the actinic keratosis has been completely removed, which should be confirmed by pathology. The surgical wound is sutured (stitched). The sutures are removed after a few days, the time depending on the size and location of the lesion. The procedure leaves a permanent scar.\n\n"

Field treatments are most effective on facial skin. Pretreatment with keratolytics (such as urea cream, salicylic acid ointment or topical retinoid), and thorough skin cleansing improves response rates. Results are variable and the course of treatment may need repeating from time to time. With the exception of diclofenac gel, field treatments all result in local inflammatory reactions such as redness, blistering and discomfort for a varying length of time.\n\n- Diclofenac is more often used as an anti-inflammatory drug. A special gel formulation (3%) in a base containing sodium hyaluronate) is applied twice daily for 3 months, it is fairly well tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratoses, but less effective than the other options listed here.\n- Piroxicam - similar to diclofenac.\n- 5-Fluorouracil is a cytotoxic agent. The cream formulation is applied once or twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks. Its effect may be enhanced by calcipotriol ointment. 5-fluorouracil may be available as a combination product along with salicylic acid.\n- Skin peels using trichloroacetic acid or Jessner solution.\n- Imiquimod cream is an immune response modifier. It is applied 2 or 3 times weekly for 4 to 16 weeks.\n- Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves applying a photosensitiser (a porphyrin chemical such as methyl aminolevulinic acid) to the affected area prior to exposing it to a source of visible light.\n- Tirbanibulin is a synthetic inhibitor of tubulin polymerisation and protein kinase signalling. This 5 day topical treatment received a product license in countries such as the USA, UK, and Germany in 2021.\n- Oral retinoids have been used in organ transplant recipients and are shown to reduce the risk of SCC development in those with numerous AKs.\n\n"

It typically affects people with an ‘atopic tendency’ clustering with hay fever, asthma, and food allergies. All races can be affected; some races are more susceptible to developing atopic dermatitis, and genetic studies are showing marked diversity of the condition’s extent (heterogeneity) between populations.\n\nAtopic dermatitis usually starts in infancy, affecting up to 20% of children. Approximately 80% of children affected develop it before the age of 6 years. All ages can be affected. Although it can settle in late childhood and adolescence, the prevalence in young adults up to 26 years of age is still 5–15%.\n\n"

Over time the dermatitis becomes chronic and the skin becomes less red but thickened (lichenified) and scaly. Cracking of the skin (fissures) can occur.\n\n"

The skin often feels dry and rough. With time the face, especially the cheeks, and flexures become involved. Young infants cannot scratch and will often rub affected areas, for example the back of the head, causing temporary hair loss. The backs of the hands can be affected due to sucking. The dermatitis is not necessarily confined to these sites and can be more extensive. The napkin area is typically spared due to the moisture retention of nappies, although irritant contact napkin dermatitis can still develop.\n\n"

The distribution becomes flexural with walking, particularly involving the antecubital and popliteal fossae (elbow and knee creases). Dribble and food can cause dermatitis around the mouth and chin. Scratching and chronic rubbing can cause the skin to become lichenified (thickened and dry), and around the eyes can lead to eye damage. Pityriasis alba, pompholyx, discoid eczema, pityriasis amiantacea, lip licker’s dermatitis, and atopic dirty neck are various manifestations of atopic dermatitis seen particularly in school-age children and adolescents. During the school years, atopic dermatitis often improves, although the barrier function of the skin is never completely normal [see Barrier function in atopic dermatitis].\n\n"

Madarosis, nodular prurigo, and lichenification may follow chronic rubbing. Discoid and papular patterns can develop. For some who had atopic dermatitis in childhood with subsequent complete resolution, it may recur on the hands due to occupational and domestic duties [see Atopic hand dermatitis]. Unusually, atopic dermatitis may develop for the first time in adulthood, as ‘adult onset’ atopic dermatitis. In women and some men, involvement of the nipples and areolae can be problematic [see Nipple eczema].\n\nKeratosis pilaris, white dermographism, hyperlinear palms, and Dennie-Morgan folds can be useful clues for atopy. A Dennie-Morgan fold is a fold of skin under the lower eyelids due to chronic eyelid dermatitis.\n\n"

Underestimation may also occur due to cultural factors and communication difficulties between patients, parents, and healthcare providers.\n\nPatients with skin of colour appear to be at particular risk of developing lichen simplex and nodular prurigo with scratching and rubbing.\n\nPostinflammatory hypo- and hyper-pigmentation occurs more commonly with skin of colour and can be more noticeable than in ethnic white skin, resulting in significant psychological distress.\n\n"

Children who developed atopic dermatitis before the age of 2 years had a lower risk of persistent disease than those who developed atopic dermatitis later in childhood or adolescence.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is typically worst between the ages of two and four years, and often improves or even clears after this. However, atopic dermatitis may be aggravated or reappear in adult life due to exposure to irritants or allergens related to caregiving, domestic duties, or certain occupations.\n\n"

However, it is predominantly linked to states of insulin resistance (IR) wherein obesity, diabetes, and/or other metabolic disorders (eg, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and generalised lipodystrophy) co-exist. Insulin in high concentrations has been shown to cross the dermal-epidermal junction, and in high concentrations to have growth-stimulating effects through its binding to type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) on keratinocytes. It is this activation of IGFR that stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes and leads to AN.\n\nOther less common presentations of AN include:\n\n- Drug-related AN, which has been associated with nicotinic acid lotion, fusidic acid ointment, subcutaneous insulin, oral contraceptives, oral corticosteroids, hormones (such as diethylstilbestrol and testosterone), triazinate, and aripiprazole\n- Familial AN, a rare autosomal dominant condition that presents at birth or in childhood and progresses until puberty after which it either stabilizes or regresses. It is due to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene\n- Autoimmune AN, which has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and Hashimoto thyroiditis\n- Acral acanthotic anomaly, a presentation that typically occurs in darker skin phenotypes and is limited to the elbows, knees, and dorsal aspects of the hands and feet\n- Unilateral AN (also called naevoid acanthosis nigricans), a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis with lesions occurring unilaterally along Blaschko lines; it can present at any age.\n\nA recently described presentation of AN-like lesions among darker-skinned individuals, involving the forehead, cheeks, including the malar areas, and fingers was also found to be strongly associated with obesity and metabolic disorders.\n\nMalignant AN is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome likely due to the release of stimulatory growth factors by tumour cells and is typically associated with gastrointestinal malignancies, especially gastric adenocarcinoma (60%); other associated cancers include hepatobiliary carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and Wilms tumour. The oral cavity is involved in 25–50% of cases.\n\nTripe palms are a variant of malignant AN with a 90% association with internal malignancy.\n\n"

An exclamation point hair is a broken strand with a relatively thick distal portion and thin proximal portion as it enters the scalp. They are the result of anagen arrest and cessation of hair shaft formation, with weakening and tapering of the shaft.\n\nSome patients may experience localised tingling or itching preceding hair loss (trichodynia).\n\nUpon regrowth, hairs may initially lack pigment and so grow back as white or blonde.\n\nNail changes can be seen in an estimated 10–40% of patients and tend to be associated with more severe disease.\n\n- Nail pitting and ridging are most common.\n- Other nail features include koilonychia, trachyonychia, Beau’s lines, onychorrhexis, onychomadesis, onycholysis, and red spots in the lunula.\n\nClick here for images\n\n"

Irritant contact dermatitis may affect anyone, providing they have had enough exposure to the irritant, but those with atopic dermatitis are particularly sensitive. Most cases of hand dermatitis are due to contact with irritants. Irritant contact dermatitis can occur immediately after a single injury or develop slowly after repeated exposure to an irritant.\n- Other forms of dermatitis, which may mimic allergic contact dermatitis.\n- Contact urticaria, in which a rash appears within minutes of exposure and fades away within minutes to hours.

Taking a very good history including information on the work environment, hobbies, products in use at home and work and sun exposure will enhance the chances of finding a diagnosis. The rash usually (but not always) completely clears up if the allergen is no longer in contact with the skin, but recurs even with slight contact with it again.\n\nThe open application test is used to confirm contact allergy to a cosmetic, such as a moisturiser. The product under suspicion is applied several times daily for several days to a small area of sensitive skin. The inner aspect of the upper arm is suitable. Contact allergy is likely if dermatitis arises in the treated area.\n\nDermatologists will perform patch tests in patients with suspected contact allergy, particularly if the reaction is severe, recurrent or chronic. The tests can identify the specific allergen causing the rash.\n\nFungal scrapings of skin for microscopy and culture can exclude fungal infection.\n\nDimethylgloxime test is available to ‘spot test’ if a product contains nickel.\n\n"

Note: many chemicals have several names, and cross-reactions to similar chemicals with different names are common.\n- Wear appropriate gloves to protect hands from touching materials to which you react and remove gloves in the appropriate way. Some chemicals will penetrate certain gloves; seek a safety expert's advice.\n- Ask your dermatologist to help.\n\nActive dermatitis is usually treated with the following:\n\n- Emollient creams\n- Topical steroids\n- Topical or oral antibiotics for secondary infection\n- Oral steroids, usually short courses, for severe cases\n- Phototherapy or photochemotherapy.\n- Azathioprine, ciclosporin or another immunosuppressive agent.\n- Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are immune-modulating calcineurin inhibitors and may prove helpful for allergic contact dermatitis.\n\n"

Aphthous ulcers can also affect the genitalia in males and females.\n\nRecurrent aphthous ulcer usually begins as a round yellowish elevated spot surrounded by a red halo. This then breaks down into a punched-out ulcer, which is covered with a loosely attached white, yellow, or greyish membrane. Surrounding tissue is healthy and unaffected. The ulcer can be painful, particularly if irritated by movement or eating certain types of food such as citrus fruit.\n\nPeople may experience a single ulcer or multiple ulcers. Multiple ulcers tend to be widely distributed throughout a person's mouth.\n\nAphthous ulceration is classified into three types.\n\n- Recurrent minor aphthous ulcer (80%). This is less than 5 mm in diameter and heals within 1–2 weeks.\n- Major aphthous ulcer, which is large (often more than 10 mm) and takes weeks or months to heal and leaves a scar.\n- Herpetiform ulcers, which are multiple pinpoint ulcers that heal within a month.

Low risk individuals should have basic blood and urine screening, and a plain chest X ray.

Prodromal itch before blistering and mucosal blisters are common. Drug withdrawal is usually required.\n\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (often called 'gliptins'), used to treat diabetes mellitus (such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and especially, vildagliptin), have also been reported to induce bullous pemphigoid. The median time to onset of bullous pemphigoid is 11 months after initiation of therapy. Unusually, mucosal involvement occurs.\n\nOther cases of bullous pemphigoid have been associated with antibiotics, penicillamine, potassium iodide, frusemide, captopril, gold, penicillin, sulfasalazine, topical fluorouracil, and second-generation antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, olanzapine).\n\n"

        "content": "Bullous pemphigoid is the result of an attack on the basement membrane of the epidermis by IgG +/- IgE immunoglobulins (antibodies) and activated T lymphocytes (white blood cells). The target is the protein BP180 (also called Type XVII collagen), or less frequently BP230 (a plakin). These proteins are within the NC16A domain of collagen XVII. They are associated with the hemidesmosomes, structures that ensure the epidermal keratinocyte cells stick to the dermis to make a waterproof seal.\n\nThe binding of the autoantibodies to the proteins and release of cytokines from the T cells lead to complement activation, recruitment of neutrophils (acute inflammatory cells) and the release of proteolytic enzymes. These destroy the hemidesmosomes and cause the formation of subepidermal blisters.\n\nThe association of neurological diseases with bullous pemphigoid is thought to relate to the presence of collagen XVII in the central nervous system and skin hemidesmosomes.\n\nA rare variant of pemphigoid with IgG antibodies directed against a 200 kDa DEJ protein has been described – there is a strong association with psoriasis (laminin gamma 1).\n\n"

It may be localised to one area, or widespread on the trunk and proximal limbs.\n\n- Frequently it affects the skin around skin folds.\n- Blisters inside the mouth and in genital sites are uncommon.\n\nSome patients have a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid made despite not having any bullae (non-bullous pemphigoid).

The dose is adjusted until the blisters have stopped appearing, which usually takes several weeks. The dose of prednisone is then slowly reduced once there are fewer than 3 significant blisters, over many months or years. As systemic steroids have many undesirable side effects, other medications are added to ensure the lowest possible dose (aiming for 5–10 mg prednisone daily).

A boil is a deep form of bacterial folliculitis; superficial folliculitis is sometimes present at the same time. Staphylococcus aureus can be cultured from the skin lesions.\n\nIf there are multiple heads, the lesion is called a carbuncle. Large boils form abscesses, defined as an accumulation of pus within a cavity. Cellulitis may also occur, ie, infection of the surrounding tissues, and this may cause fever and illness.\n\n"

They do however carry Staphylococcus aureus on the surface of their skin (staphylococcal carrier state). Why this occurs is usually not known, but it is estimated that 10–20% of the population are staphylococcal carriers.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is most commonly carried in the nostrils, armpits, between the legs and in the cleft between the buttocks. It may be transferred to other sites from the nostrils via the finger nails.\n\nTiny nicks or grazes or something rubbing against the skin can innoculate the bacteria into the wall of a hair follicle which is a weak point in the skin's defences. Once innoculated, the bacteria cause a boil which goes on to run its usual course of about 10 days.\n\nAlthough most people with boils are otherwise healthy, boils are sometimes related to immune deficiency, anaemia, diabetes, smoking or iron deficiency.\n\n"

The cleanser may cause a little dryness.\n- Use a hand sanitiser regularly to reduce the chance of reinfecting yourself or others with contaminated hands.\n- Antiseptic or antibiotic ointment or gel to apply to the inside of the nostrils.\n- Wipe the entire skin surface daily for a week with 70% isopropyl alcohol in water (this will make the skin dry).\n- Apply a topical antiseptic such as povidone iodine or chlorhexidine cream to the boils and cover with a square of gauze.\n- Your doctor may prescribe an oral antibiotic (usually the penicillin antibiotic flucloxacillin), sometimes for several weeks.\n- Other members of the family with boils should also follow a skin cleansing regime. Your doctor may also advise the family to apply topical antibiotic to their nostrils in case they are Staphylococcus aureus carriers as well.\n- If the boils fail to clear up, a swab should be taken for microbiological culture, in case of methicillin (meticillin) resistant staphylococci.\n- Sometimes, special antibiotics may be prescribed on the recommendation of a specialist, including fusidic acid, clindamycin, rifampicin and cephalosporins.\n\n"

Wash your hands several times daily or use antiseptic hand rubs.\n- Don't share your flannel or towel with other family members.\n- Maintain a clean handkerchief and don't pick your nose!\n- Change your underclothes and night attire regularly.\n- Consider modifying leisure activities that cause sweating and friction from clothing, such as squash and jogging.\n- If you are iron deficient, a course of iron tablets may help reduce infection.\n- 1000 mg of vitamin C each day has also been advocated to improve deficient neutrophil function.\n\n"

Often accompanied by other features of reactive arthritis (such as conjunctivitis and arthritis).\n- Zoon’s balanitis — symmetric “cayenne pepper spots” and orange-glazed erythema on the glans penis due to microvascular haemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition.\n- Genital lichen planus — violaceous annular papules and patches over the glans penis and scrotum; sometimes accompanied by linear white “Wickham striae” with hyperpigmented centres.\n- BXO — otherwise known as penile lichen sclerosus; hyperkeratosis of the squamous mucosa and peri-meatal glans appearing as white confluent papules or ivory-white papular lesions.\n- Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperkeratotic and micaceous balanitis — thick well circumscribed mica like scaling over the glans\n- Drug-induced balanitis — clearly demarcated erythema, oedema, and/or blistering of the glans penis; may be violaceous; history of provocative drug use before onset.\n\nClick here for images of Balanitis\n\n"

The melanocytes of blue naevi are located deeper in the skin within the dermis as compared to those of brown naevi, which are located in the more superficial epidermis.\n\nIt has been held that the deeper location of dermal melanocytes in blue naevi causes their colour to be perceived by the eye as bluish. This phenomenon has classically been extrapolated to be due to the Tyndall effect, which posits that shorter (blue) wavelengths of incident light are preferentially scattered by the deeper-located dermal melanocytes; this is in contrast to the more superficially located epidermal melanocytes which appear brown.\n\nA more recent study, however, has suggested that the perception of blue colour in blue naevi may be more aptly regarded as a relative decrease in scatter of higher wavelength red light rather than as an increase in scatter of lower wavelength blue light. Thus, these authors conclude that blue naevi are perceived as blue because they scatter less red light, leading to a shift in hue toward blue (“subtractive colour mixing”), rather than because they scatter more blue light.\n\n"

Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, first-line use of topical antibiotics, such as fusidic acid, is generally discouraged; topical antiseptics are often used as an alternative for minor infections. More serious or persistent bacterial infections are treated with oral, intravenous, or sometimes intramuscular antibiotics.\n\nIt is best to take samples (eg, swabs or blood cultures) to test which organism is responsible for an infection before commencing antibiotics. If the infection is serious (eg, suspected meningococcal disease), do not delay treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. As culture and sensitivities become available, change to an appropriate narrow-spectrum antibiotic.\n\nAntibiotics should not be prescribed if they are not indicated or unlikely to be of benefit, for example, if the infection is viral in origin. Adverse reactions include cutaneous effects and gastrointestinal side effects. Antibiotic stewardship is also an important consideration.\n\n"

A comedo is formed by the debris blocking the sebaceous duct and hair follicle. It is now known that comedones also involve inflammation (see causes of acne).\n\nThe development of comedones may involve the following factors:\n\n- Excessive activity of the male sex hormone 5-testosterone (DHT) within skin cells\n- Reduced linoleate (the salt of the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid) in sebum causing more scale and reduced barrier function\n- Proinflammatory cytokines (cell signalling proteins), such as Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-8, produced by cells lining the follicle in response to activation of the innate immune system\n- Free fatty acids made from sebum by acne bacteria\n- Overhydrated skin premenstrually, from moisturisers or in humid conditions\n- Contact with certain chemicals including oily pomades, isopropyl myristate, propylene glycol and some dyes in cosmetics\n- Rupture of the follicle by injury such as squeezing pimples, abrasive washing, chemical peels or laser treatments\n- Smoking – comedonal acne is more common in smokers than in non-smokers\n- Certain dietary factors may contribute to comedonal acne, particularly milk products and high glycaemic-index foods (sugars and fats)\n\n"

These should be applied once or twice daily as a thin smear to the entire area affected. It may take several weeks to months before worthwhile improvement occurs. Treatment needs to be continued long-term (sometimes for many years).\n\nSuitable topical agents include:\n\n- Benzoyl peroxide\n- Azelaic acid\n- Salicylic acid +/- sulfur and resorcinol\n- Glycolic acid\n- Retinoids such as tretinoin, isotretinoin, adapalene (these require a doctor's prescription)\n\nPrescription oral medications for comedonal acne include:\n\n- Hormonal therapy\n- Isotretinoin\n\nAntibiotics can also improve comedonal acne but are usually prescribed for inflammatory acne (acne vulgaris).\n\nSurgical treatments are sometimes recommended to remove persistent comedones:\n\n- Cryotherapy\n- Electrosurgery (cautery or diathermy)\n- Microdermabrasion\n\n"

It may contain clear fluid or blood (this is harmless).\n\nTreatment near the eye may result in a puffy eyelid, especially the following morning, but the swelling settles within a few days. A scab will then form and the blister gradually dries up.\n\nWhen the blister dries to a scab, apply petroleum jelly and avoid picking at the scab. The scab peels off after 5–10 days on the face and 3 weeks on the hand. A sore or scab may persist as long as 3 months on the lower leg because healing in this site is often slow.\n\n"

Blisters can also arise inside the mouth\n\nThe spread pattern can vary from child to child. There may be only a scattering of vesicles, or the entire body may be covered with up to 500 vesicles. The vesicles tend to be very itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nSome children may also experience additional symptoms such as high fever, headache, cold-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nChickenpox is usually more severe in adults and can be life-threatening in complicated cases. Most adults who get chickenpox experience prodromal symptoms for up to 48 hours before breaking out in the rash. These include fever, malaise, headache, loss of appetite and abdominal pain. Chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and can be life-threatening in complicated cases.\n\nThe blisters clear up within one to three weeks but may leave a few scars. These are most often depressed (anetoderma), but they may be thickened (hypertrophic scars). Scarring is prominent when the lesions get infected with bacteria.\n\n"

See also chickenpox pathology.\n\nLaboratory tests are often undertaken to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n- PCR detects the varicella virus in skin lesions and is the most accurate method for diagnosis.\n- The culture of blister fluid is time-consuming and is less frequently performed.\n- Serology (IgM and IgG) is most useful in pregnant women, or before prescribing immune suppression medication to determine the need for pre-treatment immunisation.\n\n"

Exposure to varicella virus in pregnancy may cause viral pneumonia, premature labour and delivery and rarely maternal death.\n- Approximately 25% of fetuses of mothers with chickenpox become infected. It is harmless to most of them. Offspring may remain asymptomatic, or develop herpes zoster at a young age without a previous history of primary chickenpox infection. They may also develop congenital varicella syndrome, one of the TORCH infections.\n- Congenital varicella syndrome occurs in up to 2% of fetuses exposed to varicella in the first 20 weeks of gestation. It can result in spontaneous abortion, fetal chorioretinitis, cataracts, limb atrophy, cerebral cortical atrophy and microcephaly, cutaneous scars, and neurological disability.\n- Mortality in newborns infected with varicella is up to 30%.\n\nPerinatal varicella\n\n- If a mother develops chickenpox just before delivery or during the 28 days after delivery, her baby is at risk of severe infection.\n\nShingles (herpes zoster)\n\n- The varicella-zoster virus remains dormant in sensory ganglia after infection.\n- It may reactivate after many years as shingles. Shingles presents with grouped vesicular lesions, which usually affect a single dermatome.\n- Other infections occurring as a result of reactivation of virus include post-herpetic neuralgia, vasculopathy, myelopathy, retinal necrosis, cerebellitis and zoster sine herpete.\n\n"

Primary chilblains are unusual in the elderly and an underlying cause should be looked for.\n\nRisk factors predisposing to the development of chilblains include:\n\n- Smoking\n- Low body mass index and poor nutrition\n- Occupational hazard for outdoor workers, such as fishermen and farmers\n- Participation in ice-skating sports\n- Underlying bone marrow disorders eg, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia\n- Underlying connective tissue disorders, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (when it is called chilblain lupus)\n- Underlying acrocyanosis and primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon\n- Familial tendency to developing chilblains.\n\nChilblains are seen in temperate climates rather than in countries with extreme cold where the air is often dry, and appropriate clothing and living conditions minimise the risk. Late winter and early spring, when it is wet and temperatures are above freezing, are the peak seasons for chilblains.\n\n"

Many reported patients had no recent exposure to cold, and a robust antiviral interferon response has been postulated to induce changes in the small blood vessels. Histology has been performed on a small number of cases and the changes described have been typical of chilblains, chilblain lupus, or a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern. The association between COVID-19 and chilblains is still being defined. However, the development of chilblain-like lesions in the absence of exposure to damp cold or secondary causes, should be suspected as being related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n"

However, chilblains can develop on any areas exposed to chronic cold, such as the thighs/hips of horse riders (‘equestrian panniculitis’). Chilblains develop several hours after exposure to damp cold and last for more than 24 hours.\n\nChilblains typically present as:\n\n- Itch and/or burning pain\n- Localised swelling\n- Blanchable red/purple discolouration.\n\nDermoscopy is not very informative, but examination of the nailfold capillaries may be useful if an underlying connective tissue disease is suspected.\n\n"

[see Perniosis pathology].\n\nThe Mayo Clinic has developed diagnostic criteria for chilblains:\n\nMajor criterion (required) — localised redness and swelling of acral sites lasting at least 24 hours.\n\nMinor criteria (at least one of the following):\n\n- Onset and/or worsening in cooler months\n- Histopathology consistent with chilblains\n- Improvement with warming and drying.\n\nChilblains are classified as idiopathic (primary) if there is no associated cause, and secondary if a cause can be identified.\n\nInvestigations for secondary causes of chilblains may include:\n\n- Full blood count\n- ANA, rheumatoid factor, antiphospholipid antibodies\n- Complement levels\n- Protein electrophoresis\n- Cold agglutinins and, in children, cryoglobulins.\n\n"

There are many pathological variants including:\n\n- cellular\n- aneurysmal\n- epithelioid\n- atypical\n- lipidized ankle-type\n- palisading\n- cholesterotic\n\nIn case of doubt, immunohistochemical staining is used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n"

All eczema is a dermatitis, but not all dermatitis is eczema.\n\n- Dermatitis, strictly speaking, includes any cause of skin inflammation affecting the epidermis.\n- Eczema is derived from the Greek word for “to boil or bubble over”, which pathologically manifests as oedema within the epidermis (called spongiosis).\n\nThe term dermatitis is sometimes mistakenly attributed to mean an eczema induced by an occupational factor; this is erroneous.\n\n"

Common types include:\n\n- Atopic dermatitis — a common form of dermatitis occurring in children and adults, and often occurring in families with a background of asthma and hay fever\n- Seborrhoeic dermatitis — common chronic eczema affecting the face, scalp, ears and major flexures, due to a reaction to yeasts that colonise the skin\n- Discoid (nummular) dermatitis — coin-shaped patches of dermatitis usually affecting the limbs\n- Lichen simplex — chronic dermatitis that thickens due to perpetual scratching\n- Pityriasis alba — pale patches of dermatitis affecting the cheeks\n- Hand dermatitis — internal, external irritants and allergic factors may all play a part even in a single individual\n- Eyelid dermatitis — again, often of mixed cause\n- Otitis externa — dermatitis affecting the ear canal and the pinna\n- Venous or gravitational dermatitis — dermatitis due to malfunction of the lower leg vein valves\n- Juvenile plantar dermatitis — a glazed and fissured forefoot eczema occurring in children\n- Metabolic dermatitis — seen in some nutritional and endocrine disorders\n- Chronic superficial scaly dermatitis — finger-shaped patches of eczema occurring on the trunk\n- Asteatotic dermatitis — crazy-paving shaped dermatitis due to degreasing of the skin from excessive bathing and soap use on the legs in the elderly\n- Halo dermatitis or Meyerson naevus — this can surround a benign mole\n- Erythrodermic dermatitis — severe dermatitis when more than 80% of the skin is affected.\n\n"

If the hands are affected, use gloves and tools to make sure the skin is not irritated by friction, detergents, solvents, other chemicals, or excessive water.\n\nApply emollients frequently\nEmollients include bath oils, soap substitutes and moisturising creams. They can be applied to dermatitis as frequently as required to relieve itching, scaling, and dryness. Emollients should also be used on the unaffected skin to reduce dryness. It may be necessary to try several different products to find one that suits. Many people find one or more of the following helpful: glycerine and cetomacrogol cream, white soft paraffin/liquid paraffin mixed, fatty cream, wool fat lotions, or urea cream.\n\nAvoid allergens\n\nIf patch testing has identified contact allergy, exposure to the allergen should be avoided.\n\nAnti-inflammatory treatments include:\n\nTopical steroids\nTopical steroids are anti-inflammatory creams or ointments available on prescription to apply just to the patches once or twice daily for 2–4 weeks. They may also be available as steroid impregnated tape. Topical steroids reduce symptoms and clear the dermatitis.\n\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics (eg, erythromycin, flucloxacillin) are often prescribed if the dermatitis is blistered, sticky, or crusted. Sometimes discoid eczema clears completely on oral antibiotics, only to recur when they are discontinued.\n\nOther treatments sometimes prescribed for severe discoid eczema include:\n\nOral antihistamines\nAntihistamine pills may reduce the itch in some patients with discoid eczema. They do not clear the rash.\n\nUltraviolet radiation (UV) treatment\nPhototherapy several times weekly for 6–12 weeks for generalised or widespread discoid eczema can reduce itch and improve the rash.\n\nSteroid injections\nIntralesional steroids are sometimes injected into one or two particularly stubborn areas of discoid eczema. This treatment is unsuitable for multiple lesions.\n\nOral steroids\nSystemic steroids are reserved for severe and extensive cases of discoid eczema. They are usually prescribed for a few weeks before continuing topical steroids and emollients on residual dermatitis.\n\nOther oral treatments\nPersistent and troublesome discoid eczema is occasionally treated with methotrexate, azathioprine or ciclosporin. These medicines require careful monitoring by a specialist dermatologist. They may be more suitable than long-term systemic steroids.\n\n"

Gastrointestinal symptoms are usually mild; some patients remain symptom-free.\n- Around 15–25% of coeliac patients have concurrent DH.

Dapsone must be stopped immediately in these scenarios.\n\nIf intolerant or allergic to dapsone, the following may be useful:\n\n- Ultra-potent topical steroids\n- Systemic steroids\n- Colchicine\n- Ciclosporin\n- Azathioprine\n- Sulfapyridine\n- Rituximab.\n\nThere are reports that combination therapy with dapsone and sulfasalazine may be effective in patients who do not tolerate increasing doses of dapsone monotherapy.\n\nTopical dapsone 5% gel was also shown to be effective as an adjuvant treatment for DH.

Follicular hyperkeratosis (plugs of keratin within hair follicles) is common. When this scale is removed using sticky tape the horny plugs can be seen giving rise to the “carpet-tack” sign.\n- As DLE progresses atrophic scarring and scarring alopecia is common. This is associated with hyper- and or hypo- pigmentary change and is especially noticeable in those with skin of colour.\n- DLE is typically located on the nose, cheeks, ear lobes, and conchal bowl (Shuster sign). It may involve lips, oral mucosa, nose, or eyelids.\n\nSigns of generalised DLE include:\n\n- The morphology of the lesions is similar to that on the face and scalp but they are distributed widely including the anterior chest, upper back, dorsum of hands and less commonly on the lower limbs, palms, and soles.

Affected sites include:\n\n- Seborrhoeic areas of the face (scalp margins, forehead, ears, around the nostrils and sides of nose, eyebrows, and beard area)\n- Scalp and neck\n- Central chest and back\n- Skin folds, such as armpits, groin, under the breasts, and between the buttocks\n\nThe papules have a firm, harsh feel like coarse sandpaper and may be skin-coloured, yellow-brown, or brown in colour. If several of the small papules grow together they may form larger warty lesions which can become quite smelly within skin folds. There may be a heavily crusted rash similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n\nOther skin signs may include:\n\n- Small pits on the palms and soles\n- Bleeding under the skin.\n\nAtypical presentations of Darier disease are common.\n\n- Flat, freckle-like lesions\n- Blistered papules\n- Large, raised, warty lesions\n- A linear pattern, with papules following the lines of embryonal development of the skin (segmental distribution)\n\nAcne conglobata (cystic acne) is associated with Darier disease in some individuals.\n\n"

It has been estimated that at least 1 in every 10,000 patients treated with an anticonvulsant will develop drug hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\nThe risk of drug hypersensitivity syndrome in patients on allopurinol depends on the dose of allopurinol, associated kidney disease, and concomitant thiazide diuretics.\n\nIt has been rarely reported with many other medications. It can be very difficult to determine the exact cause of drug hypersensitivity syndrome if several medicines have been commenced in preceding weeks. In about 10% of cases, the causative drug is never identified.\n\nDrug hypersensitivity syndrome occurring within 2 weeks of starting the responsible drug is most likely with beta-lactam antibiotics or iodinated contrast media. onset is delayed more than 2 weeks with anticonvulsants and allopurinol.\n\n"

A temporal association between medicine use and the start of the syndrome is the strongest evidence.\n\nThe European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs and Collection of Biological Samples (RegiSCAR) has produced diagnostic criteria to assist in the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity syndrome. RegiSCAR inclusion criteria for potential cases require at least 3 of the following:\n\n- Hospitalisation\n- Reaction suspected to be drug-related\n- Acute skin rash\n- Fever above 38C\n- Enlarged lymph nodes at two sites\n- Involvement of at least one internal organ\n- Blood count abnormalities such as low platelets, raised eosinophils, or abnormal lymphocyte count.\n\nAttempts to confirm which drug has caused drug hypersensitivity syndrome may include patch tests. Patch testing has been reported to be most successful for anticonvulsant drugs, with 50% positive reactions. It is not useful for allopurinol, with 0% positive reactions. Lymphocyte transformation testing is available in some centres, where specialist interpretation may reveal the causative drug in the majority of cases.\n\n"

Episodes can be isolated, recurrent, or persistent.\n\nIn most cases, erythema multiforme is precipitated by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection; alternative triggers include other infections, medications, and vaccinations. Classic ‘target’ lesions present as concentric rings of colour variation which develop symmetrically in an acral distribution, with or without involvement of mucous membranes.\n\nErythema multiforme is a distinct entity from Steven Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n\n"

Other infectious triggers include:\n\n- HSV type 2\n- Cytomegalovirus\n- Epstein-Barr virus\n- Influenza virus\n- Vulvovaginal candidiasis\n- SARS-CoV-2\n- Orf.\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae infection is often listed as a trigger of erythema multiforme, however mucocutaneous manifestations associated with this infection have recently been classified as their own independent entity, Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM).\n\nMedications which may trigger erythema multiforme include:\n\n- Antibiotics (including erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, penicillins, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines)\n- Anti-epileptics\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n- Vaccinations (most common cause in infants).\n\nOther conditions associated with erythema multiforme (usually in persistent disease) include:\n\n- Inflammatory bowel disease\n- Hepatitis C\n- Leukaemia\n- Lymphoma\n- Solid organ cancer malignancy.\n\nIn many cases, the inciting factor remains unknown.\n\nMost research on the mechanism of disease has focused on the herpes-associated presentation. The herpes virus is phagocytosed by mononuclear cells which express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (a skin-homing receptor). Engulfed viral DNA is then transferred to the epidermis and into keratinocytes. Within the keratinocyte layer, expression of viral DNA fragments induces a cell-mediated immune response, including the production of interferon-γ which upregulates the inflammatory process.\n\n"

Mixed septal and lobular inflammation can occur.\n\nNodules due to predominantly septal panniculitis include:\n\n- Various forms of scleroderma\n- Medium vessel vasculitis, for example, due to polyarteritis nodosa in which there are tender subcutaneous nodules associated with ulceration, necrosis, livedo racemosa, fever, joint pain, myalgia, and peripheral neuropathy\n- Necrobiosis lipoidica\n- Eosinophilic panniculitis\n- Rheumatoid nodule.\n\nNodules due to predominantly lobular panniculitis include:\n\n- Connective tissue disease (eg, panniculitis associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus)\n- Erythema nodosum leprosum (type 2 lepra reaction due to leprosy)\n- Pancreatic panniculitis in which subcutaneous nodules may become ulcerated or fluctuant. Laboratory tests reveal elevated lipase, amylase and trypsin levels\n- Traumatic panniculitis\n- Nodular vasculitis/erythema induratum in which ulcerated, draining nodules affect the posterior calves\n- Lipodermatosclerosis, which is a consequence of venous insufficiency\n- Infection of the subcutaneous fat with bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi, which may cause ulcerated, fluctuant, and draining abscesses\n- Malignant infiltration.\n\n"

Signs appear 5–12 days after contact with an infected individual, who may or may not have visible cold sores.\n\nEczema herpeticum may also complicate recurrent herpes. However, repeated episodes of eczema herpeticum are unusual.\n\nEczema herpeticum can affect males and females of all ages but is more commonly seen in infants and children with atopic dermatitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis appear to have reduced immunity to herpes infection. Their underlying dermatitis can be mild to severe, active or inactive.\n\nEczema herpeticum is better called Kaposi varicelliform eruption when a breakdown of the skin barrier is not due to eczema. Examples of non-eczematous conditions prone to severe localised herpes infections are:\n\n- Thermal burns\n- Pemphigus vulgaris\n- Darier disease\n- Benign familial pemphigus\n- Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides\n- Ichthyosis.\n\nOther viruses may occasionally be responsible for a similar eruption, such as eczema coxsackium due to coxsackievirus A16 (the cause of  hand foot and mouth disease).\n\nAs  smallpox has been eliminated, disseminated vaccinia as a consequence of smallpox vaccination is now very rare. It was reported to be very severe, with mortality of up to 50%.\n\n"

New patches form and spread over 7–10 days and may rarely be widely disseminated throughout the body.\n\nThe patient is unwell, with fever and swollen local lymph nodes.\n\n- The blisters are monomorphic, that is, they all appear similar to each other.\n- They may be filled with clear yellow fluid or thick purulent material.\n- They are often blood-stained i.e., red, purple or black.\n- New blisters have central dimples (umbilication).\n- They may weep or bleed.\n- Older blisters crust over and form sores (erosions)\n- Lesions heal over 2–6 weeks.\n- In severe cases where the skin has been destroyed by infection, small white scars may persist long term.\n\nSecondary bacterial infection with staphylococci or  streptococci may lead to impetigo and cellulitis.\n\nSevere eczema herpeticum may affect multiple organs, including the eyes, brain, lung, and liver.

Intravenous aciclovir is prescribed if the patient is too sick to take tablets, or if the infection is deteriorating despite treatment.\n\nSecondary bacterial skin infection is treated with systemic antibiotics.\n\nTopical steroids previously have not been recommended but recent evidence suggests that they are safe to use, and may be necessary to treat active atopic dermatitis.\n\nConsult an ophthalmologist when eyelid or eye involvement is seen or suspected.\n\n"

The diagnosis can be confirmed by skin biopsy in which the typical features of superficial or deep erythema annulare centrifugum are noted: a dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate involving either the superficial or deep vascular plexus, which is known as a ‘coat-sleeve’ appearance. Secondary changes to the epidermis may include spongiosis (inflammation of intercellular oedema), parakeratosis (disturbance in the keratinisation process), and hyperkeratosis (thickening of the outer layer of the epidermis) [2].\n\nInvestigations for an underlying cause should be guided by the patient's history and examination findings. An age- and symptom-appropriate cancer screening should be undertaken.\n\nToenail clippings and skin scrapings should be submitted for mycology if onychomycosis, tinea pedis, or tinea corporis are suspected.\n\n"

Keep it locked up so other people cannot mistakenly use it to treat a rash.\n\nPretreatment with cryotherapy or keratolytics, such as urea cream or glycolic acid lotion, is useful to minimise scaling and permit optimum absorption of the active ingredient, 5-FU.\n\nFluorouracil cream is applied once or twice a day after washing with plain water. A tiny amount of the cream should be gently rubbed into all of the treatment areas with a fingertip. It is important to apply it to all the skin and not just visible lesions. Afterwards, rinse the finger thoroughly with water (or use a glove or cotton bud to apply the cream). Treatment for actinic keratoses is continued for 2 to 4 weeks. Longer may be necessary for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.\n\nThe manufacturer's guidelines indicate that the maximum area to be treated at one time is 500 cm2.\n\n"

Tretinoin cream enhances the effect of fluorouracil by peeling off the top layer of skin. It reduces the time required for the course of fluorouracil treatment. Tretinoin cream can be continued afterwards long term to reduce the signs of skin ageing and prevent deterioration, using very careful sun protection.\n- Combining low-potency 0.5% fluorouracil cream with 10% salicylic acid> (Actikerall™) has also been shown to be effective for actinic keratoses on the face and hands and forearms over a 12-week course. It is especially useful for hyperkeratotic (horny) lesions.\n- 5% fluorouracil cream with 0.005% calcipotriol ointment has been reported to improve efficacy and reduce the number of days required for treatment of actinic keratoses compared to 5% fluorouracil cream alone.\n\n"

After cleansing the area to be treated, a thick coat of fluorouracil cream is applied to scaly lesions and surrounding skin, often circumferentially around the limb. About 10 to 20 g of 5-FU is used for each limb. Paraffin gauze is applied over the fluorouracil cream to areas of movement (eg ankle) as protection. The limb is then carefully bandaged using loose layers of zinc oxide (to improve healing and reduce pain), cotton conforming bandage and crepe or self-adherent roll for compression.\n\nThe chemowrap is left in place for 7 days, then removed. The treated skin is washed and gently scrubbed to remove loose skin and scabs. Fluorouracil treatment is repeated once weekly for 4 to 12 weeks. If treated areas become eroded, treatment is stopped and petroleum jelly is applied to the affected area. It can be recommenced if necessary.\n\n"

These raw areas result from the destruction of defective skin cells. They are a necessary part of treatment and are expected to heal, once the treatment is stopped.\n\nTreated areas can be covered with a light dressing or left open. An occlusive dressing will increase penetration of 5-FU and enhance the effect and adverse reactions. Make-up can be worn if the reaction is mild, but should be avoided in the case of erosions and ulceration.\n\nArrange for your dermatologist, family doctor, or skin cancer nurse to review you during treatment to check on progress and to determine how long to continue using fluorouracil cream.

Keep it off the lips, unless specifically instructed to use it on this site. Use it with care in skin folds (such as those around the nose and lips), since it may irritate more severely in these areas.\n\nDue to interaction with sunlight, it is best to use fluorouracil cream during the winter months. Treated skin should normally be very carefully protected from the sun; stay indoors during the middle part of the day. If the treated area is inadvertently exposed to the sun, the reaction to fluorouracil is more vigorous than normal.\n\nThere have been several reports of detrimental effects on pets following accidental ingestion of fluorouracil. Keep tubes out of reach, wash hands thoroughly after application, and do not allow pets to lick areas of application.\n\n"

If you have been given no specific instructions, apply plain white petrolatum thinly to raw and crusted areas at bedtime. Stop the petrolatum when the crusts and scabs have healed.\n\nWhen treatment is stopped the skin heals rapidly. It takes two to four weeks for healthy new skin to replace the sun-damaged skin destroyed by the fluorouracil cream. After healing, the treated areas are often redder than normal and may feel more sensitive; this redness and sensitivity will gradually fade over a few weeks. Occasionally it persists for several months.\n\nPersistent or recurrent actinic keratoses can be treated with a further course of fluorouracil cream, imiquimod cream or by cryotherapy. However, it is important to ask your dermatologist if this is appropriate because skin cancers can look very similar and may need surgery or other procedures.\n\n"

It may also affect the surrounding skin, however, very rarely causes systemic involvement.\n\nClinical types include:\n\n- Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis — the distal end and sides of the nail lift or become discoloured and crumble.\n- Superficial white onychomycosis — flaky, white patches and pits appear on the top of the nail plate.\n- Proximal subungual onychomycosis — the proximal nail plate close to the lunula becomes discoloured and thickened. This pattern of disease is often related to underlying HIV infection.\n- Endonyx onychomycosis — milky white discolouration of the nail plate develops without subungual hyperkeratosis or onycholysis.\n- Onychauxis.\n\nFeatures that are observed include:\n\n- Subungual hyperkeratosis — scaling occurs under the nail\n- Jagged and crumbling of the free end of the nail plate\n- Discolouration of the nail, eg, yellow, white, grey, or green discolouration\n- Ridging, crumbling, and sometimes eventual complete nail plate destruction\n- Scaling on the plantar skin and web spaces due to associated tinea pedis\n- Onychoma or dermatophytoma — a thick localised area of infection in the nail plate.\n\nOnychomycosis may complicate other nail pathology such as trauma or psoriasis.\n\nCandida infection of the nail plate generally results from paronychia and starts near the nail fold (the cuticle). The nail fold is swollen and red, lifted off the nail plate. White, yellow, green, or black marks appear on the nearby nail and spread. The nail may lift off its bed and is tender if you press on it.\n\nMould infections are similar in appearance to tinea unguium.\n\nClick here for images\n\n"

        "content": "Fixed drug eruption is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction. In the initial phase memory CD8+ T-cells at the dermo-epidermal junction release interferon-gamma when activated by the medication antigen causing epidermal basal layer damage. Recruited T-cells and neutrophils damage melanocytes and keratinocytes. During the resolution phase, dermal macrophages collect the melanin resulting in the typical post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Regenerating basal keratinocytes release interleukin-15 leading to the formation of resident memory CD8+ T-cells which remain quiescent but in a primed state ready to respond to the chemical antigen again.\n\nFixed drug eruption is usually due to oral medications, with antimicrobials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) being the most common culprits. Less common drug exposures may be topical or intravaginal. Fixed food eruptions may be due to antibiotics, flavouring or colouring agents, or preservatives in the food. Herbal supplements and caffeine have also been implicated. For a more detailed list, see the Appendix at the end.\n\n"

        "content": "Fixed drug eruption can be categorised by clinical morphology. The most common form is the localised pigmenting type; other presentations include bullous (localised or generalised), mucosal, non-pigmenting, or generalised.\n\nFixed drug eruption typically presents as a single (or small number of) well-defined, round or oval red or violaceous patch or plaque which may blister or ulcerate. It is usually asymptomatic but can be itchy or painful. Over the next few days and weeks, the surface may become scaly or crusted before peeling, and the colour fades to leave brown post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation tends to be more prominent in skin of colour.\n\nIn contrast to many other drug eruptions, the patient remains systemically well.\n\nThe hands and feet, eyelids, and anogenital areas are common sites. Lesions in the oral mucosa are usually found on the lips, tongue and hard palate. A fixed drug eruption may occur at the same location as previous skin trauma such as a burn, insect bite, or venepuncture.\n\nOn the first occasion, the eruption may develop after weeks to years of regular ingestion of the drug, but subsequent episodes develop within minutes to hours of recommencing the implicated drug. A patch of fixed drug eruption shows a refractory period during which it will not flare even with re-exposure. With subsequent episodes, the original patch may enlarge and more patches may appear. The post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation darkens with each recurrence.\n\n"

Blisters are subepidermal if present. A late lesion shows upper dermal melanophages.\n- Oral challenge test — with a low dose of the suspected drug although there is typically a refractory period during which time the patch will not flare. This is contraindicated in patients with generalised bullous fixed drug eruption.\n- Patch test — using the suspected drug in soft paraffin applied to the lesion site is positive in 50% of cases.

Around 40% of women by age 50 show signs of hair loss and less than 45% of women reach the age of 80 with a full head of hair.\n\nIn FPHL, there is diffuse thinning of hair on the scalp due to increased hair shedding or a reduction in hair volume, or both. It is normal to lose up to 50-100 hairs a day. Another condition called chronic telogen effluvium also presents with increased hair shedding and is often confused with FPHL. It is important to differentiate between these conditions as management for both conditions differ.\n\nFPHL presents quite differently from the more easily recognisable male pattern baldness, which usually begins with a receding frontal hairline that progresses to a bald patch on top of the head. It is very uncommon for women to bald following the male pattern unless there is excessive production of androgens in the body.\n\n"

The mode of inheritance is polygenic, indicating that there are many genes that contribute to FPHL, and these genes could be inherited from either parent or both. Genetic testing to assess the risk of balding is currently not recommended, as it is unreliable.\n\nCurrently, it is not clear if androgens (male sex hormones) play a role in FPHL, although androgens have a clear role in male pattern baldness. The majority of women with FPHL have normal levels of androgens in their bloodstream. Due to this uncertain relationship, the term FPHL is preferred to ‘female androgenetic alopecia’.\n\nThe role of oestrogen is uncertain. FPHL is more common after the menopause suggesting oestrogens may be stimulatory for hair growth. But laboratory experiments have also suggested oestrogens may suppress hair growth.\n\n"

Hair grows from the base of the follicle at a rate of about one centimetre a month for about three years. This growth phase is called anagen. After anagen, the hair dies (catagen hair) and no longer grows. It sits dormant in the follicle for a three-month phase called telogen. After telogen, the hair follicle undergoes another anagen phase to produce new hair that grows out of the same follicle. As it grows, the old telogen hair is dislodged or pushed out.

        "content": "FPHL can affect women in any age group, but it occurs more commonly after menopause. The hair loss process is not constant and usually occurs in fits and bursts. It is not uncommon to have accelerated phases of hair loss for 3–6 months, followed by periods of stability lasting 6–18 months. Without medication, it tends to progress in severity over the next few decades of life.\n\n"

        "content": "Many studies have shown that hair loss is not merely a cosmetic issue, but it also causes significant psychological distress. Compared to unaffected women, those affected have a more negative body image and are less able to cope with daily functioning. Hair loss can be associated with low self-esteem, depression, introversion, and feelings of unattractiveness. It is especially hard to live in a society that places great value on youthful appearance and attractiveness.\n\n"

However, a few women with FPHL are found to have excessive levels of androgens. These women also tend to suffer from acne, irregular menses and excessive facial and body hair. These symptoms are characteristic of the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) although the majority of women with PCOS do not experience hair loss. Less often, congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be responsible.\n\n"

        "heading": "What treatments are available?",
        "level": "h2",
        "content": "Treatments are available for FPHL although there is no cure. It is important to manage expectations when seeking treatment, as the aim is to slow or stop the progression of hair loss rather than to promote hair regrowth. However, some women do experience hair regrowth with treatment. Results are variable, and it is not possible to predict who may or may not benefit from treatment.\n\nA Cochrane systematic review published in 2012 concluded that minoxidil solution was effective for FPHL. Minoxidil is available as 2% and 5% solutions; the stronger preparation is more likely to irritate and may cause undesirable hair growth unintentionally on areas other than the scalp.\n\nHormonal treatment, i.e. oral medications that block the effects of androgens (e.g. spironolactone, cyproterone, finasteride and flutamide) is also often tried.\n\nA combination of low dose oral minoxidil (eg, 2.5 mg daily) and spironolactone (25 mg daily) has been shown to significantly improve hair growth, reduce shedding and improve hair density.\n\nOnce started, treatment needs to continue for at least six months before the benefits can be assessed, and it is important not to stop treatment without discussing it with your doctor first. Long term treatment is usually necessary to sustain the benefits.\n\nCosmetic camouflages include coloured hair sprays to cover thinning areas on the scalp, hair bulking fibre powder, and hair wigs. Hair transplantation for FPHL is becoming more popular although not everyone is suitable for this procedure.\n\nLow-level laser therapy is of unproven benefit in pattern balding, but one device has been approved by the FDA for marketing. Platelet-rich plasma injections are also under investigation. Further studies are required to determine the magnitude of the benefit if any.\n\n"

        "content": "Your first stop would be to see your general practitioner (GP) who can perform a medical workup to exclude other reasons for hair loss. Your GP can refer you to a dermatologist for further management of FPHL. Sometimes, it may be necessary for your doctor to perform a scalp biopsy to confirm this diagnosis.\n\nIt is important to seek reliable information and advice from authoritative sources as there are many bogus treatments that are expensive and do not work.\n\n"

Actinic granuloma is considered by some to be a photo-aggravated variant of granuloma annulare, and by others to be a distinct entity.\n\n"

This protein is normally present in the upper epidermis, but there are various genetic variants that lead to a weakness of the skin's barrier function. These include a common cause of dry skin, ichthyosis vulgaris.\n\nCosmetic or laundry products containing the antiseptic, benzalkonium chloride, may be responsible for some cases. Acting as a surfactant, benzalkonium chloride may disrupt cellular lipid membranes and inactivate enzymes within the skin, inducing proliferation, abnormal development of the skin cells (keratinocytes), and irritant contact dermatitis. Recurrent flexural pellagroid dermatitis [1] was reported to be an irritant contact dermatitis to the anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), in soapless cleansing bars.\n\nThis may induce proliferation and abnormal development of the skin cells (keratinocytes).\n\nChanges in the skin microbiota have also been blamed.\n\n"

The amount shed during active lesions is 100 to 1000 times greater. Minor injury helps spread the virus, especially into the skin.

The local lymph glands are enlarged and tender.\n- In women, similar lesions occur on the external genitalia and the mucosae of the vulva, vagina and cervix. Pain and difficulty passing urine are common.\n\nSome people also have flu-like symptoms with fever, headache and muscular aches and pains. Symptoms tend to be more severe in women than in men.\n\nFollowing the initial infection, immunity develops but does not fully protect against further episodes (recurrence).

One study of couples who avoided sexual contact during recurrences found that, over 12 months, only 1 out of 10 passed the virus on to their partner. In that study, condoms were not used.

Antiviral drugs are indicated for primary herpes simplex infection, as symptoms may last for three weeks if no treatment is given.

These antiviral drugs will stop the herpes simplex virus multiplying once it reaches the skin or mucous membranes but cannot eradicate the virus from its resting stage within the nerve cells. They can, therefore, shorten and prevent episodes while the drug is being taken, but a single course cannot prevent future episodes.\n\nDifferent formulations of topical antiviral creams are available. They are not generally recommended for genital herpes and are not subsidised for this use in New Zealand.\n\nOther treatments being studied include:\n\n- Imiquimod cream, an immune enhancer\n- Human leukocyte interferon-alpha cream.\n\nBoth appear less beneficial than conventional antiviral drugs.\n\n"

Genital psoriasis affects the genital skin, which includes the pubic area, vulva or penis, skin folds including natal cleft, and buttocks. It is known as anogenital psoriasis when psoriasis also affects perianal skin. Psoriasis does not affect mucosal surfaces.\n\nPsoriasis is one of the most common diseases affecting anogenital skin. It can be part of more generalised plaque psoriasis, but it may also be the only affected area in 2–5% of cases. Rarely, generalised and localised pustular psoriasis can also affect the genital skin.\n\nGenital skin can also be affected in inverse or flexural psoriasis, psoriasis that mainly affects the skin folds. Genital psoriasis may be associated with considerable discomfort and embarrassment, and may severely impair the quality of life and sexual well-being of those affected.\n\n"

These usually lack scale, as friction between the skin surfaces rubs it off. Scales may be seen on the outer parts of the genital skin. Scales can be easily scraped off, leaving pinpoint bleeding.\n\nIn women, vulval psoriasis appears symmetrical. It can vary from silvery, scaly patches adjacent to the labia majora to moist, greyish plaques or glossy red plaques without scaling in the skin folds.\n\nIn men, the penis and scrotum may be involved. The glans penis, the bulbous part of the end of the penis, and the corona (the base or \"crown\" of the glans) are most commonly affected. In circumcised men, plaques can be more scaly than on the rest of the genital skin. In uncircumcised men, nonscaling plaques are more common.\n\nPsoriatic napkin eruption presents as red and sometimes silvery plaques with well-defined borders in the nappy area of children under the age of 2 years. It usually clears up after a few months to a year, but may later generalise into plaque psoriasis.\n\nPsoriasis in genital areas can be very itchy at times. The plaques may also be fissured and painful.\n\nPsoriasis does not lead to scarring. The skin can return to a normal appearance with treatment or spontaneously.\n\nSee images of genital psoriasis.\n\n"

Less commonly, the forehead, eyelids, or one side of the scalp may be involved. The swelling may feel soft, firm or nodular when touched.\n\nRecurrent attacks of granulomatous cheilitis may occur within days or even years after the first episode. At each episode, the swelling may become larger, more persistent and eventually become permanent. At this time the lips may crack, bleed and heal leaving a reddish-brown colour with scaling. This can be painful. Eventually, the lip takes on the consistency of hard rubber.\n\nSee more images of granulomatous cheilitis\n\nOther symptoms that may accompany granulomatous cheilitis include:\n\n- Fever, headache and visual disturbances\n- Mild enlargement of regional lymph nodes in 50% of cases\n- Fissured or plicated (pleat-like effect) tongue in 20–40% of cases\n- Facial palsy; this can be intermittent, then possibly permanent and can be unilateral or bilateral, and partial or complete.

        "content": "Herpes zoster is characterised by dermatomal distribution, that is the blisters are confined to the cutaneous distribution of one or two adjacent sensory nerves. This is usually unilateral, with a sharp cut-off at the anterior and posterior midlines.\n\nThe clinical presentation of herpes zoster depends on the age and health of the patient and which dermatome is affected.\n\nThe first sign of herpes zoster is usually localised pain without tenderness or any visible skin change. It may be severe, relating to one or more sensory nerves. The pain may be just in one spot, or it may spread out. The patient may feel quite unwell with fever and headache. The lymph nodes draining the affected area are often enlarged and tender.\n\nWithin one to three days of the onset of pain, a blistering rash appears in the painful area of skin. It starts as a crop of red papules. New lesions continue to erupt for several days within the distribution of the affected nerve, each blistering or becoming pustular then crusting over.\n\nThe chest (thoracic), neck (cervical), forehead (ophthalmic) and lumbar/sacral sensory nerve supply regions are most commonly affected at all ages. The frequency of ophthalmic herpes zoster increases with age. Herpes zoster occasionally causes blisters inside the mouth or ears, and can also affect the genital area. Sometimes there is pain without rash—herpes zoster \"sine eruptione\"—or rash without pain, most often in children.\n\nPain and general symptoms subside gradually as the eruption disappears. In uncomplicated cases, recovery is complete within 2–3 weeks in children and young adults, and within 3–4 weeks in older patients.\n\nSee more images of herpes zoster.\n\n"

There is a 50% chance of complete recovery, but some improvement can be expected in nearly all cases\n- Infection of internal organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and brain (encephalitis)\n\nHerpes zoster is infectious to people who have not previously had chickenpox.\n\nHerpes zoster in the early months of pregnancy can harm the fetus, but luckily this is rare.

Post-herpetic neuralgia may be a continuous burning sensation with increased sensitivity in the affected areas or spasmodic shooting pain.

These can damage the outer stratum corneum, removing lipids and disturbing the skin’s barrier function. Water loss and inflammation lead to further impairment of barrier function.\n\nIn atopic dermatitis, a deficiency in or defective function of the filaggrin protein in the stratum corneum leads to barrier dysfunction resulting in water loss and easy penetration by irritants and allergens [3].\n\nContact allergy is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction with elicitation and memory phases involving T lymphocytes and release of cytokines [2].\n\n"

During a recurrence, the virus follows the nerves onto the skin or mucous membranes, where it multiplies, causing the clinical lesion.

In crowded, underdeveloped areas of the world, nearly all children have been infected by the age of 5. In less crowded places, the incidence is lower; for example, less than half of university entrants in Britain have been infected. Type 2 HSV infections occur mainly after puberty and are often transmitted sexually.\n\nHSV is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with someone with active herpes simplex, which is infectious for 7–12 days. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus in saliva or genital secretions can also lead to transmission of HSV, but this is infrequent, as the amount shed from inactive lesions is 100 to 1000 times less than when it is active. The incubation period is 2–12 days.\n\nMinor injury helps inoculate HSV into the skin. For example:\n\n- A thumb sucker may transmit the virus from their mouth to their thumb.\n- A health-care worker may develop herpetic whitlow\n- A rugby player may get a cluster of blisters on one cheek (‘scrumpox’).\n\n"

        "content": "Primary infection with HSV can be mild or subclinical, but symptomatic infection tends to be more severe than recurrences. Type 2 HSV is more often symptomatic than Type 1 HSV.\n\nPrimary Type 1 HSV most often presents as gingivostomatitis, in children between 1 and 5 years of age. Symptoms include fever, which may be high, restlessness and excessive dribbling. Drinking and eating are painful, and the breath is foul. The gums are swollen and red and bleed easily. Whitish vesicles evolve to yellowish ulcers on the tongue, throat, palate and inside the cheeks. Local lymph glands are enlarged and tender.\n\nThe fever subsides after 3–5 days and recovery is usually complete within 2 weeks.\n\nPrimary Type 2 HSV usually presents as genital herpes after the onset of sexual activity. Painful vesicles, ulcers, redness and swelling last for 2 to 3 weeks, if untreated, and are often accompanied by fever and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\nIn males, herpes most often affects the glans, foreskin and shaft of the penis. Anal herpes is more common in males who have sex with men than with heterosexual partners.\n\nIn females, herpes most often arises on the vulva and in the vagina. It is often painful or difficult to pass urine. Infection of the cervix may progress to severe ulceration.\n\n"

They usually return to roughly the same site as the primary infection.\n\n- Recurrent Type 1 HSV can occur on any site, most frequently the face, particularly the lips (herpes simplex labialis).\n- Recurrent Type 2 HSV may also occur on any site, but most often affects the genitals or buttocks.\n\nItching or burning is followed an hour or two later by an irregular cluster of small, closely grouped, often umbilicated vesicles on a red base. They normally heal in 7–10 days without scarring. The affected person may feel well or suffer from fever, pain and have enlarged local lymph nodes.\n\nHerpetic vesicles are sometimes arranged in a line rather like shingles and are said to have a zosteriform distribution, particularly when affecting the lower chest or lumbar region.\n\nWhite patches or scars may occur at the site of recurrent HSV attacks and are more evident in those with the skin of colour.\n\nSee more images of herpes simplex.\n\n"

It usually starts as red spots or bumps (which may have a ‘hive-like’ appearance) which rapidly change to small dark purple bumps (palpable purpura) within the first 24 hours. The most common sites of involvement are the lower legs, buttocks, elbows and knees. The rash is symmetrical and may even become generalised. Blisters and/or ulcers may develop in the affected areas.\n\nArthritis is present in 75% of cases and usually involves one to four joints, especially the ankles and knees. It may be transient and move between different joints.\n\nAbdominal pain is present in half to three-quarters of patients and precedes the rash in up to one third. Abdominal pain may be associated with diarrhoea and bleeding from the bowel. Orchitis and intussusception are possible complications.\n\nKidney involvement is seen in up to 50% of cases. It is usually mild and self-limiting, however, it is important that it is diagnosed and followed up as persistent impairment may occur. It normally occurs within a few days to one month after the onset of the other symptoms.

Hair thickness and length varies according to the site.\n\n- Vellus hair is fine, light in colour, and short in length\n- Terminal or androgenic hair is thicker, darker and longer\n\nA hair shaft grows within a follicle at a rate of about 1 cm per month. It is due to cell division within the hair bulb at the base of the follicle. The cells produce the three layers of the hair shaft (medulla, cortex, cuticle), which are mainly made of the protein keratin (which is also the main structure of skin and nails).\n\nHair growth follows a cycle. However, these phases are not synchronised, and any hair may be at a particular phase at random.\n\nThe three main phases of the hair cycle are:\n\n- Anagen: actively growing hair, most of them\n- Catagen: in-between phase of 2–3 weeks when growth stops and the follicle shrinks, 1–3% of hairs\n- Telogen: resting phase for 1–4 months, up to 10% of hairs in a normal scalp.\n\nHair length depends on the duration of anagen. Short hairs (eyelashes, eyebrows, hair on arms and legs) have a short anagen phase of around one month. Anagen lasts up to 6 years or longer in scalp hair.\n\n\n\nImage © 1998 Merck Sharpe and Dohme (with permission)\n\n"

The halos develop at intervals round one or several moles, but not around all of them.\n\nThere are four stages of a halo naevus. It may take several years to complete the cycle. Multiple halo naevi can be at different stages.\n\n- Stage 1: A rim of pale skin surrounds a mole\n- Stage 2: The mole may become pinker or less pigmented, and fades away\n- Stage 3: A circular or oval area of depigmentation persists\n- Stage 4: The affected skin gradually returns to its normal colour\n\n"

Microbiome overgrowth in warm moist environments can cause intertrigo.\n\nIntertrigo is classified into infectious and inflammatory origins, but they often overlap.\n\n- Infections tend to be unilateral and asymmetrical.\n- Atopic dermatitis is usually bilateral and symmetrical, affecting the flexures of the neck, knees and elbows.\n- Other inflammatory disorders also tend to be symmetrical affecting the armpits, groins, under the breasts, and the abdominal folds.\n\n"

A hairdryer on cool setting is an effective approach for drying underarms and breasts.\n- Sweating can be reduced with an antiperspirant cream or powder.\n- Bacterial infection may be treated with topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid cream, mupirocin ointment, or oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin and erythromycin.\n- Yeasts and fungi may be treated with topical antifungals such as clotrimazole and terbinafine cream or oral antifungal agents such as itraconazole or terbinafine.\n- Inflammatory skin diseases are often treated with low potency topical steroid creams such as hydrocortisone. More potent steroids are best avoided in the flexures because they can cause skin thinning, resulting in stretch marks (striae atrophicae) and rarely, ulcers. Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus ointment or pimecrolimus cream are also effective in skin folds.\n\n"

Ecthyma is a deep form of impetigo causing deeper erosions of the skin into the dermis.\n\nSecondary infection of wounds or other skin lesions with the same pathogens is called ‘impetiginisation’.\n\nFor more images of impetigo, click here.\n\n"

Irritants remove oils and natural moisturising factor from the outer layer of the skin, allowing chemical irritants to penetrate the skin barrier and trigger inflammation.\n\nFactors influencing the development and severity of the dermatitis include:\n\n- Concentration, amount, and properties of the irritant\n- Duration and frequency of exposure, for example short concentrated or repeated prolonged low exposure\n- Skin susceptibility such as pre-existing skin damage or atopic tendency\n- Mechanical trauma including hand scrubbing\n- Environmental factors such as temperature extremes or humidity.\n\nEveryday examples of common skin irritants are water, soaps, and, in the era of COVID-19, hand sanitisers. Occupational irritants can include wet work, detergents, solvents, acids, alkalis, adhesives, and metalworking fluids. Topical medications such as retinoids and benzoyl peroxide, may cause irritant contact dermatitis with long-term use. Friction, sweating, and heat are examples of environmental factors. Irritant dermatitis is often the result of the cumulative impact of multiple irritants.\n\n"

A course of treatment may be completed in a few months or continue for several years. For acne, some prescribers have targeted a total cumulative dose of 120–140 mg/kg, in the hope of reducing relapse, but the evidence for this remains controversial. The general trend has been to use lower dosages, unrelated to body weight (eg, 10 mg/day).\n\nThe individual dose prescribed by the dermatologist depends on:\n\n- Prescriber preference\n- Patient body weight\n- The specific condition being treated\n- The severity of the skin condition\n- Response to treatment\n- Other treatment used at the same time\n- Side effects experienced.\n\nIsotretinoin is better taken with water or milk after food to help with its absorption. It may be taken on an empty stomach, but absorption may be halved. There is no particular advantage in splitting the dose over the day. A newer formulation (isotretinoin-lidose) can be taken without food.\n\n"

Rarely, isotretinoin induces depression and low mood, when on stopping the drug, depression lifts but returns with reintroduction of the medication. Acne itself can be the source of distress, anxiety and depression. In rare instances, suicidal ideation and completed suicide occurs during isotretinoin treatment, but this can also rarely be the case in people taking antibiotics for acne, so it is difficult to be certain whether the changes are due to the disease, scarring, the drug, or something else.\n\nThe largest meta-analysis reviewing the data of 1.6 million people identified the 1 year absolute risk of suicide, suicidal ideation, completed suicide, and self harm to be less than 0.5% each, and depression 3.8%, all being lower than the risk in the general adolescent population, suggesting that there was no increased relative risk of psychiatric condition in isotretinoin users. In the 2-4 years after isotretinoin the psychiatric illness rate was lower than those who had not had isotretinoin. There was a slightly increased risk of depression in those who had isotretinoin and had a past history of depression.

The most reliable method of avoiding pregnancy is not to have sex. No method of contraception is completely reliable. \"Natural\" family planning is particularly risky.\n- If sexually active, two reliable methods of contraception should be used. Discuss contraception with your doctor (general practitioner, family planning specialist, gynaecologist or dermatologist). The combined oral contraceptive, IUD (intrauterine device), a progesterone implant, or medroxyprogesterone injection may be suitable.\n- The low-dose progesterone mini-pill on its own is not recommended.\n\nA prescription for emergency contraception may be available from a medical practitioner (GP or family planning clinic) or accredited pharmacy. It prevents 85% of pregnancies if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\nIf contraception fails, termination of pregnancy (an abortion) may be advised if pregnancy arises during treatment with isotretinoin or within a month of discontinuing it.\n\n"

High levels of total IgE can occur in allergic conditions, parasitic infections, certain immune-related disorders, and malignancies.\n\nThe sensitivity of specific IgE tests ranges from 60% to 95% and the specificity from 30% to 95%, depending upon the type of allergen and the age of the patient [3]. There is a good predictive value (> 90%) for food (cow’s milk, egg, fish, and peanuts), pollens (grass and trees) and dust mites. Tests for some medicines, latex, moulds, and venom have poor sensitivity but greater specificity [3,4]. Note:\n\n- A positive test result means sensitisation to an allergen.\n- The indicated level of IgE may not correlate with the extent or severity of symptoms when exposed to the allergen.\n- A normal level of IgE may not exclude allergic disorders.\n- A result may be misleading. False-positive and false-negative results can be due to cross-reactivity, the age of the patient, or the type and duration of exposure to the allergen.\n\nFurther evaluation can be done by skin prick testing or by challenging the patient to a specific allergen in vivo.\n\n"

Regression and proliferation may be seen in same lesion.\n- Regression or involution phase (several years): The bright red colour changes to a dull grey surface associated with flattening, softening, and shrinking from the centre towards the periphery. While a grey stage is suggestive of involutional change, a white infantile haemangioma may be a sign of impending ulceration. The most rapid phase of involution is seen between 1–4 years and approximately 50% of lesions involute by 5 years, 70% by 7 years, and 90% by 9 years of age.\n\nInfantile haemangioma with minimal or arrested growth (IH-MAG) has an abortive or minimal growth in 25% of the lesion’s surface area, appearing as telangiectatic patches with or without papules, lacking a significant proliferative phase.

        "content": "Jewellery allergy is a common cause of contact allergic dermatitis. Most jewellery allergy is caused by the metals nickel (see nickel allergy) and cobalt (see cobalt allergy) which is used in the manufacture of precious metal alloys. In less expensive jewellery, nickel is often used in the base metal which is then plated with gold or silver. Many people who believe that they are allergic to gold or silver jewellery are allergic to nickel, which can occur as a trace element in gold or silver or has been used in the manufacture of gold jewellery to whiten and strengthen the piece.\n\nJewellery allergy presents as dermatitis in places where nickel-containing metal is touching the skin. The most common sites of jewellery allergy are the earlobes (from earrings), the fingers (from rings), and around the neck (from necklaces); the affected areas become intensely itchy and may become red and blistered (acute dermatitis) or dry, thickened and pigmented (chronic dermatitis). Sometimes dermatitis later affects areas that are not in contact with jewellery, particularly the hands. Pompholyx is a blistering type of hand dermatitis that is prevalent in people with a previous history of jewellery allergy and may be due to contact with other sources of nickel such as coins and keys.\n\n"

Irritant reactions are more common in people that suffer from sensitive skin or atopic dermatitis\n- Psoriasis and vitiligo can koebnerise and arise at a site or injury; for example, they could arise at the site of a tight watch strap, necklace or bangle\n- A piercing site may be infected with Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in oozing and crusting (impetigo or wound infection).\n\nUnrelated rashes should also be considered if patch tests prove negative.\n\n"

For people with metal allergy, particularly nickel allergy, the question is which metals are your gold jewellery alloyed with? Gold can be alloyed with many different types of metals which alter its hardness, colour and other properties. For example, yellow gold may be alloyed with silver and copper, while white gold is usually alloyed with nickel. Rhodium, a silvery-white metal related to platinum, is often used to plate yellow gold to make it into white gold. And even white gold with nickel is often rhodium-plated to make it appear whiter and shinier. Although the initial plating will protect you against any nickel in the gold, it eventually wears off over months or years. This leaves the white gold (alloyed with nickel) in contact with your skin.\n\n"

This is usually confined to skin sites in contact with the metal but can spread more widely in severe cases.\n\nNickel allergy is more common in women, probably because they are more likely to wear jewellery than men, although this is changing.

Once your nickel or cobalt allergy is confirmed, it is essential to avoid contact with that metal. The following tips may help when purchasing jewellery.\n\n- Alternative white gold alloys are available based on palladium, silver and other white metals, but the palladium alloys are more expensive than those using nickel. High-karat white gold alloys are far more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver.\n- When having ears or other body parts pierced, have it done with a stainless steel needle and make sure your jewellery is made of stainless steel or either 18- or 24 karat gold.\n- Look for jewellery that is hypoallergenic, i.e. made of stainless steel, at least 18-karat gold, sterling silver, or polycarbonate plastic.\n- If you must wear earrings that contain nickel, add plastic covers made specifically for earring studs.\n- If your wedding ring or another item of jewellery that you wear daily causes a reaction, you can ask a jeweller about having it plated in a non-allergic metal, such as rhodium or platinum. However, the coating will eventually wear off and need re-plating.\n\n"

The phosphate is provided by ATP, and each JAK and tyrosine kinase recognises a slightly different ATP-binding pocket. Overexpression of these pathways can result in the development of autoimmune disease and malignancies.\n\nJAK inhibitors (JAKi) can be classified as:\n\n- Pan-JAKi — delgocitinib, peficitinib\n- JAK1i — oclacitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, itacitinib\n- JAK1/2i — baricitinib, ruxolitinib\n- JAK1/3i — tofacitinib\n- JAK3i — decernotinib, ritlecitinib\n- TYK2 inhibitors — deucravacitinib, brepocitinib.\n\n"

Tuberculosis screening should therefore be undertaken before starting treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Reactivation of herpes viruses appears to be common, therefore zoster vaccination prior to commencing treatment is recommended.\n\nCommon adverse side effects of JAK inhibitors include:\n\n- Nasopharyngitis\n- Infection of upper respiratory and urinary tracts\n- Headache\n- Nausea and diarrhoea\n- Acne - mild acne occurs in about 15% of those with eczema treated with JAKis - it is usually responsive to topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics or retinoids, and seldom requires drug withdrawal.\n\nSelective JAK inhibitors may show unique adverse effect profiles such as cytopenias linked to selective JAK2 inhibition.\n\nTofacitinib has been used long-term in patients with rheumatoid arthritis:\n\n- Increased lipids may be seen during the first 3 months of treatment, then stabilise\n- Malignancies are not increased except for non-melanoma skin cancers\n- The TGA in Australia warns high dose (10mg bd) should be used with caution in patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, serious infections, and herpes zoster infection.\n\nIn 2021, the FDA issued new updated black box warnings for baricitinib and upadacitinib in line with warnings already in place for tofacitinib. Tofacitinib has been reported to carry increased risks of serious heart-related events, blood clots, and death even at low dose. Although similar adverse events have not yet been reported with baricitinib and upadacitinib, the FDA found the risks have not been adequately evaluated and issued the warning due to the similar mechanisms of action.\n\nAn association between JAK inhibitors and malignancy (eg, T-cell lymphomas) is currently under investigation and is not fully understood. There have been rare cases of T-cell lymphomas reported in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, but the overall incidence appears to be low and causality has not been established.\n\nApproved datasheets are the official source of information for medicines, including approved uses, doses, and safety information. Check the individual datasheet in your country for information about medicines.\n\nWe suggest you refer to your national drug approval agency such as the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), UK Medicines and Healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) / emc, and NZ Medsafe, or a national or state-approved formulary eg, the New Zealand Formulary (NZF) and New Zealand Formulary for Children (NZFC) and the British National Formulary (BNF) and British National Formulary for Children  (BNFC).\n\n"

        "content": "The exact cause of JIA is unclear, but a pronounced immune response in a perpetuating loop of both innate and adaptive immunity is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of JIA. Aberrant activation of the innate immune system lead to the dysregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 play a critical inciting role. The effects of these cytokines provide explanations for the various clinical features seen in systemic JIA. These effects include:\n\n- Bone marrow granulopoiesis (proliferation of granulocytes)\n- Increase in osteoclast activity (cells that absorb bone)\n- Hepatocyte stimulation\n- Activation of thermoregulatory functions (body temperature) [3,4].\n\nThe increased recruitment of inflammatory cells in the joint synovial membrane was demonstrated in several studies by a significant elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the synovial fluid of affected children. Proinflammatory cytokines in the synovium lead to increased production and accumulation of synovial fluid and thickening of the synovial lining. This chronic synovial inflammation is apparent and common to all JIA subtypes. In addition, RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand) cytokine, which is associated with bone resorption (breakdown) and cartilage damage, was reported to be present in large amounts in the synovial membrane of children with JIA.\n\nSome studies have consistently supported associations between enthesitis-related JIA and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms; there appear to be increased associations, especially with early-onset disease. A monogenic form of systemic JIA with an underlying mutation in a regulatory protein involved in macrophage metabolism has been described [2,3].\n\nEnvironmental factors may contribute to the development of JIA. Some studies have suggested associations with exposure to antibiotics, a bacterial infection in immunosuppressed individuals, and maternal smoking during pregnancy [2,4].\n\n"

These tend to occur on the trunk, axillae, and proximal extremities but are not commonly seen on the palms, soles, or the face. Persistent plaques, periorbital oedema, or erythema are less common but may be observed.\n\nAlthough rashes in JIA are seldom pruritic, they can be elicited by cutaneous injury or scratching (Koebner phenomenon), in which case the lesions exhibit a linear appearance.\n\nChildren with JIA often present with limping and stiffness, without any known injury or prior infections. Common non-cutaneous manifestations include:\n\n- Joint pain and swelling\n- High spiking daily fever (quotidian pattern)\n- Myalgia\n- Limited movement\n- Enthesitis\n- A sore throat\n- Lymphadenopathy\n- Hepatosplenomegaly [1–3].\n\n"

According to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria for systemic JIA, arthritis must have persisted for at least 6 weeks and fever for 2 weeks, accompanied by one or more of the following:\n\n- Transient erythematous rash\n- Generalised lymphadenopathy\n- Hepatosplenomegaly\n- Serositis (inflammation of a serous membrane) [5].\n\nWhen JIA is suspected, paediatric rheumatologists should be involved promptly to initiate the appropriate investigations and to minimise any delay in treatment. Further investigations including laboratory tests and imaging are helpful to confirm the diagnosis or to classify arthritis into a specific subtype. The test results can also be useful to guide treatment and to monitor the disease course.\n\nThe most relevant laboratory tests for JIA are:\n\n- A complete blood count — anaemia, thrombocytosis, and leucocytosis are often present in systemic JIA whereas they are not typically seen in oligoarticular JIA\n- Erythrocyte sediment rate (ESR) — this is significantly elevated in systemic JIA but may be normal or mild to moderately elevated in other subtypes\n- C-reactive protein (CRP) — this is elevated to varying degrees in the different subtypes of JIA\n- Antinuclear antibody (ANA) — this is often negative in systemic JIA but may be positive in oligoarticular and polyarticular forms of JIA\n- RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP); these are useful to identify RF-positive polyarthritis.\n\nPathology is not required for a definitive diagnosis of JIA, but the exanthem in systemic JIA characteristically exhibits a perivascular and interstitial neutrophil-dominant infiltrate; this can also be referred to as neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis, a common pattern in autoinflammatory processes [3].\n\nImaging can provide information about the involved joints if the clinical examination findings are equivocal. An ultrasound scan can assess synovitis in the joints, and magnetic resonance imaging may be used to rule out other conditions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis (inflammation of the joint lining) [2].\n\n"

Correlations have been made with mutations in filaggrin (a key protein in skin barrier function).\n\nKeratosis pilaris tends to be prominent in the winter months and is likely due to the reduced moisture content of the air.\n\n"

Higher power reveals enlarged atypical keratinocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasm that do not extend beyond the level of the sweat glands. These features may be impossible to see in partial or shave biopsy samples, which are not recommended.\n\nSome otherwise typical KAs show squamous cells in a peripheral zone with atypical mitotic figures, hyperchromatic nuclei, and penetration into surrounding tissue. Such lesions are often reported as SCC, KA-type to reflect uncertainty about their true nature.\n\nUnfortunately, dermoscopy cannot reliably discriminate KA from SCC.\n\n"

The blisters burst to leave expanding collarettes of scale and circular or oval, tender, erythematous peeled areas. These peeled areas lack a normal barrier function and may become dry and cracked. However, they are not generally itchy.\n\nSometimes on the ends of the fingers, the split in the skin is deeper, in which case the skin feels hard and numb and takes longer to peel off.

Keloids can arise months to years after an injury.\n\nThe pathogenesis is hypothesised to involve dysregulation of the normal healing process resulting in excessive production of collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, and extracellular matrix proteins. There is an increase in the number of fibroblasts and mast cells. Growth factors and cytokines are altered in keloid scars, with increased amounts of TNF alpha, interferon-beta and interleukin 6.\n\n"

Topical antifungal agents are not effective due to deep invasion of fungus into the hair follicle.\n\n- Terbinafine\n- Itraconazole\n- Griseofulvin (no longer available in New Zealand)\n\nAntibiotics may be needed if there is bacterial infection present. Antifungal shampoos containing ketoconazole or ciclopirox help to reduce the risk of spread of infection to others.\n\nThe hair normally grows back after the infection is treated, but sometimes hair loss is permanent, especially if the infection has been longstanding.\n\n"

It is associated with diabetes mellitus, but is not associated with HIV infection.\n- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi sarcoma — this mainly affects men who have sex with men (MSM). Kaposi sarcoma is one of the most common forms of cancer in Uganda and Zambia, especially in children.\n- Endemic or African Kaposi sarcoma — this arises in some parts of Africa in children and young adults.\n- Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma — as a result of drug treatment causing immune suppression.\n\nIn the United States, Kaposi sarcoma was particularly common in the 1980s. It remains prevalent amongst HIV-positive men who have had sex with men (MSM), in which it has a very aggressive course. It occurs less frequently in intravenous drug users and is rare in women, haemophiliacs, or their sexual partners. HIV–associated Kaposi sarcoma is more common in women than in men in some parts of Africa. It has become less common in the US and Europe because of effective highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV.\n\nIatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma is a particular concern for organ transplant patients, especially in geographic areas associated with high levels of infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Most have the virus before transplantation, but the drugs cause it to reactivate. Use of corticosteroids and biologics like rituximab, infliximab, and abatacept, prescribed for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, are also prone to develop Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n"

Data is emerging that non-sexual modes of transmission can occur, possibly via saliva or arthropod bites.\n- It is also associated with the production of specific cytokines or cell signalling proteins, genetic factors, hormonal factors and immunodeficiency. Decreasing CD4 cell count has a strong association with AIDS-associated and classic Kaposi sarcoma.\n\nKSHV may lie dormant, or replicate and cause disease. KSHV may also cause some forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Castleman disease.\n\n"

Initially, the lesions are small and painless, but they can ulcerate and become painful.\n\nThere are various forms:\n\n- Localised nodular KS\n- Locally aggressive KS\n- Generalised lymphadenopathic KS\n- Patch stage KS\n- Localised plaques of KS\n- Exophytic KS\n- Infiltrative plaques of KS\n- Disseminated cutaneous and visceral KS\n- Telangiectatic KS\n- Keloidal KS\n- Ecchymotic KS\n- Lymphangioma-like/cavernous KS.\n\nKaposi sarcoma often starts as flat patches on one or both lower legs, often in association with lymphoedema. The patches evolve into plaques, nodules or scaly tumours.\n\nKaposi sarcoma in association with HIV infection may develop at any time during the illness. Generally, the greater the immunosuppression (eg, with CD4 cell counts less than 200/mm3), the more extensive and aggressive the Kaposi sarcoma will be.\n\nKaposi sarcoma lesions can also occur internally; in the gut, lungs, genitals, lymphatic system and elsewhere. These internal lesions may cause symptoms such as:\n\n- Discomfort with swallowing\n- Bleeding\n- Haematemesis\n- Haematochezia\n- Melaena\n- Bowel obstruction\n- Shortness of breath\n- Swollen legs.\n\nSee more images of Kaposi sarcoma.\n\n"

The histopathology of Kaposi sarcoma shows red cells in slit-like spaces formed by atypical spindle cell proliferation of endothelial cells and associated with inflammatory cells.\n\n"

Skin peeling may occur in the convalescent stage of the illness.\n- Oral signs – the typical changes include redness within the mouth or on the pharynx, strawberry tongue, and red or cracked lips.\n- Eye signs – redness of the bulbar conjunctivae (whites of the eyes) without exudate or stickiness.\n- Peripheral limb signs – including firm swelling of the hands and feet, sometimes including the fingers and toes, with redness of the palms and soles. Periungual desquamation (peeling of skin around the fingernails) may occur during the convalescent stage of the illness.\n- Lymphadenopathy – swollen lymph glands can occur, often on one side of the neck. One lymph gland of at least 1.5cm in length is considered diagnostically enlarged.\n\nNot all of the cardinal signs may be present in any one child with Kawasaki disease and not all features may be present at the same time. Some features may appear and disappear before others arise.\n\nChildren with Kawasaki disease are often unusually irritable, out of proportion to the other signs exhibited.

        "content": "- The KTP laser works on the principle of selective photothermolysis.\n- The selected wavelength of laser light is absorbed to a high degree by the target structure (called a chromophore) and is absorbed less by surrounding tissue.\n- The skin chromophores targeted by the KTP laser are melanin, oxyhaemoglobin and red tattoo pigment.\n- The pulse duration of laser energy is shorter than the target structure’s thermal relaxation time (the time taken for the target to cool by 50% of its peak temperature after irradiation).\n- This ensures that the impact of thermal energy is limited to the target structure and does not affect the surrounding tissue. Modern KTP lasers also have integrated cooling systems to help protect the epidermis, particularly when doing vascular work.\n- When KTP laser light hits the skin, it is reflected, transmitted, or absorbed.\n- Absorbed light energy is converted to thermal energy (heat) by the intended targets (chromophores), thereby killing the target cells.\n- Complications result when energy intended for the target chromophore is nonselectively diffused and absorbed by surrounding tissues and structures. Because melanin is targeted by this wavelength, the KTP laser is rarely used in darker skin types.\n- The effects of the KTP laser on the skin can be modified by altering the pulse width and degree of cooling. In the case of tattoo pigment, the pulse width is narrowed to nanoseconds (Q-switched KTP) and the clinical effect is photomechanical/acoustic. Picosecond lasers may be more effective for pigment fragmentation but at very short pulse widths, the creation of a plasma veil is a limiting factor.\n\n"

New papules and plaques often have a purple or violet hue, except on palms and soles where they are yellowish-brown.\n- Plaques resolve after some months to leave greyish-brown post-inflammatory macules that can take a year or longer to fade.\n\nClick here for more images of cutaneous lichen planus\n\n"

Results may reveal colloid bodies in the papillary dermis with irregular deposits.\n\nPatch testing may be recommended for patients with oral lichen planus affecting the gums and who have amalgam fillings, to assess for contact allergy to thiomersal (a mercurial compound) and other metals.\n\n"

Local treatments for the symptomatic cutaneous or mucosal disease are:\n\n- Potent topical corticosteroids (including steroid impregnated tape)\n- Topical calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus ointment, and pimecrolimus cream\n- Topical retinoids\n- Intralesional steroid injections.\n\nSystemic treatment for widespread lichen planus or severe local disease often includes a 1- to 3-month course of systemic steroids (eg, prednisone), while commencing another agent from the following list:\n\n- Acitretin\n- Hydroxychloroquine\n- Methotrexate\n- Azathioprine\n- Mycophenolate mofetil\n- Phototherapy.\n\nAnecdotal success is reported from long courses of antibiotics e.g. metronidazole, sulfasalazine, antifungals (such as griseofulvin), and JAK inhibitors. Lichen planopilaris is reported to improve with pioglitazone and tetracyclines.\n\nIn lichen planus actinicus, phototherapy should be avoided because lesions are typically triggered by sun exposure. Sun protection, including use of sunscreen, is an essential component of treatment.\n\nIn oral lichen planus, limited evidence is found in using apremilast. Successful treatment of oral and cutaneous lichen planus with adalimumab has previously been reported. Tildrakizumab has been shown to demonstrate positive results in erosive oral lichen planus in an isolated case study.\n\nIn cases of oral lichen planus affecting the gums and buccal mucosa with contact allergy to mercury, the lichen planus may resolve on replacing the fillings with composite material. If the lichen planus is not due to mercury allergy, removing amalgam fillings is very unlikely to result in a cure.\n\nFor more information see, oral lichen planus and erosive lichen planus.\n\n"

Autoimmune diseases are associated with antibodies to a specific protein.\n\n- Extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM-1) antibodies have been detected in 60–80% of women with vulval lichen sclerosus.\n- Antibodies to other unknown proteins may account for other cases, explaining differing presentations of lichen sclerosus and response to treatment.\n- However, these antibodies could be epigenetic, ie, the results of disease rather than the cause of disease.\n\nMale genital lichen sclerosus is rare in men circumcised in infancy. It has been suggested that it may be caused by chronic, intermittent damage by urine occluded under the foreskin.\n\nAs onset in women is commonly postmenopausal, a relative lack of oestrogen may be significant.\n\n"

A potent topical steroid (eg, mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment) may also be used in mild disease or when symptoms are controlled.\n\n- An ointment base is less likely than cream to sting or to cause contact dermatitis.\n- A thin smear should be precisely applied to the white plaques and rubbed in gently.\n- Most patients will be told to apply the steroid ointment once a day. After one to three months (depending on the severity of the disease), the ointment can be used less often.\n- Topical steroid may need to be continued once or twice a week to control symptoms or to prevent lichen sclerosus recurring.\n- Itch often settles within a few days, but it may take weeks to months for the skin to return to normal (if at all).\n- One 30-g tube of topical steroid should last 3 to 6 months or longer.\n\nThe doctor should reassess the treated area after a few weeks, as a response to treatment is quite variable.\n\nTopical steroids are safe when used appropriately. However, excessive use or application to the wrong site can result in adverse effects. In anogenital areas, these include:\n\n- Red, thin skin\n- Burning discomfort\n- Periorificial dermatitis\n- Candida albicans infection (eg, vulvovaginal thrush)\n\nIt is most important to follow instructions carefully and to attend follow-up appointments regularly.\n\n"

Early concern that these medications may have the potential to accelerate cancer growth in the presence of oncogenic human papillomavirus (the cause of genital warts) appears unfounded.\n- Topical retinoid (eg, tretinoin cream) is not well tolerated on genital skin but may be applied to other sites affected by lichen sclerosus.

Procedures include:\n\n- Simple perineotomy (a division of adhesions)\n- Fenton procedure (an incision that is repaired transversely)\n- Perineoplasty (excision of involved tissue and vaginal mucosal advancement)\n\nUnfortunately, lichen sclerosus sometimes closes up the vaginal opening again after surgery has initially appeared successful.

It may be itchy or have a mild stinging sensation.\n\nThe clinical features of lichenoid keratosis vary depending on the inflammatory stage of the lesion.\n\nMultiple eruptive lichenoid keratoses in sun-exposed sites are also described. Their colour varies from an initial reddish brown to a greyish purple/brown as the lesion resolves several weeks or months later.\n\n"

Later on the grey dots also disappear, as the lesion resolves.\n\nA skin biopsy is required if clinical examination and dermoscopy cannot differentiate between lichenoid keratosis and other solitary erythematous lesions.\n\nHistopathology resembles lichen planus or lichenoid drug eruption, with some slight differences.

        "content": "Livedo reticularis results from a disturbance of blood flow to the skin, causing low blood flow and reduced oxygen tension to the skin. Cutaneous vasculature is comprised of a series of 1–3 cm cones. The apex of each cone is located deep within the dermis at the site of an ascending arteriole. At the margin of each cone, the density of the arterial bed is decreased, and the superficial venous plexus is more prominent. Any pathological or physiological process which impairs blood flow to the skin results in higher amounts of deoxygenated haemoglobin, leading to a livid discolouration.\n\nPhysiological arteriolar vasospasm in response to cold, produces reversible skin discolouration, such as in cutis marmorata. Prolonged vasospasm, thrombosis or hyperviscosity can cause the pathological skin changes of livedo racemosa.\n\nA unilateral form of livedo reticularis due to local heat injury is known as erythema ab igne.\n\n"

Investigations are undertaken to seek for an underlying cause (see above) based on careful history and examination, as extensive screening studies are unlikely to be helpful. The lupus anticoagulant panel should be ordered in acquired livedo that is not induced by the cold.\n\nIf required, it is best to take at least two biopsies from red/blue and white areas of the livedo and to ask for serial sections to be performed. A palpable site is ideal for a biopsy if present. The red area may just show non-diagnostic telangiectasia. The central white, ischaemic area may reveal an occluded vessel. Even a large skin biopsy of the centre of livedo racemosa ring may be reported as normal. Multiple biopsies may increase the diagnostic yield. The goal of a biopsy is to obtain samples of the medium vessel found in the deep reticular dermis and subcutaneous fat, which may require a wedge or large punch biopsy for increased yield.\n\nEarly signs of vasculopathy in livedo racemosa are lymphocytes and histiocytes attaching to endothelial cells. The cells join with fibrin to occlude the lumen of capillaries (lymphocytic thrombophilic arteritis).\n\nThis should be distinguished from medium vessel neutrophilic vasculitis occurring in cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Other capillaries may be dilated, or replaced by scar tissue (fibrosis).\n\n"

Lentigo maligna is also known as Hutchinson melanotic freckle.\n\nLentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma in which the malignant cells are confined to the tissue of origin, the epidermis, hence it is often reported as ‘in situ’ melanoma. It occurs in sun damaged skin so is generally found on the face or neck, particularly the nose and cheek. It grows slowly in diameter over 5 to 20 years or longer.\n\nLentigo maligna melanoma is diagnosed when the melanoma cells have invaded into the dermis and deeper layers of skin. Lentigo maligna has a lower rate of transformation to invasive melanoma than the other forms of melanoma in situ (under 5% overall). However, the risk of invasive melanoma is greater in larger lesions, with up to 50% of those with diameter of greater than 4 cm being reported to have an invasive focus.\n\nManagement of melanoma is evolving.

Thus lentigo maligna is more common in outdoor workers, in older people and in association with solar damage and keratinocyte skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). Although often occurring in those with very fair skin (skin phototype 1 and 2), it may also occur in those who tan quite easily (phototype 3). It is rare in brown or black skin (phototype 4-6).\n\nLentigo maligna is more common in males than females. The majority of patients with lentigo maligna are older than 40 years, and the peak age of diagnosis is be between 60 and 80 years.\n\nUnlike superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo maligna is not related to the number of melanocytic naevi (moles) or atypical naevi.\n\n"

It becomes more distinctive and atypical in time, often growing to several centimetres over several years or even decades. Like other flat forms of melanoma, it can be recognised by the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variation, large Diameter and Evolving.\n\nThe characteristics of lentigo maligna include:\n\n- Large size: >6 mm and often several centimetres in diameter at diagnosis\n- Irregular shape\n- Variable pigmentation – colours may include light brown or tan, dark brown, pink, red or white\n- Smooth surface.\n\nInvasive melanoma is reported to arise within lentigo maligna in 3-10% of cases. It may be difficult to determine whether this has occurred just from the appearance, but the following features are very suspicious.\n\n- Thickening of part of the lesion\n- Increasing number of colours, especially blue or black\n- Ulceration or bleeding\n- Itching or stinging\n\nSee more images of lentigo maligna melanoma ...\n\n"

However, lentigo maligna shows greater variation in the thickness of the lines making up the network, often forming an atypical rhomboid pattern associated with greyish dots, the structure tends to be irregular, and there is variation in colour.\n\n"

Partial biopsy is less accurate than complete excision biopsy, as a single small biopsy could miss a malignant focus. However sometimes the lesion is very large, and before performing significant surgery, a partial biopsy is arranged to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor should remove a long ellipse of skin, take biopsies from multiple sites or carefully shave a representative area for histology.\n\nThe pathological diagnosis of melanoma and its precursors can be very difficult. Some lesions clinically typical of lentigo maligna are reported to show junctional melanocytic proliferation alone (with or without atypia), others have the criteria to diagnose in situ melanoma, and a few show invasive cancer.\n\nThe histological features of lentigo maligna include a predominantly junctional confluent proliferation of melanocytes and extension along adnexal structures. Solar elastosis (degeneration of elastic tissue within dermis) is typically prominent. Immunostains eg SAC R21 may improve accuracy of diagnosis in borderline cases.\n\n"

This means cutting it out and repairing the defect by simply closing the wound and stitching it up, creating a flap or by skin grafting.\n\nLentigo maligna has an unusually high risk of recurrence (up to 20%). For this reason, it is usually removed with a margin of healthy tissue, which can be difficult to achieve on facial skin. The ideal margin for all forms of melanoma in situ is 5-10mm, depending on how well defined are the edges of the lesion. Recommended margins for invasive melanoma are based on its thickness: it is 1 cm if less than 1 mm and 1-2 cm if the melanoma is over 1 mm in depth. If the margin and extent of the lentigo maligna is unclear, mapped serial excision may be recommended (margin-controlled, Mohs micrographic surgery or 'slow Mohs'), in an attempt to remove all the malignant cells and to spare healthy skin.\n\nOther treatments for lentigo maligna may be considered if it is difficult to remove the lesion surgically, or surgery will be very deforming, or there is a major contraindication to surgery:\n\n- Radiotherapy — superficial X-rays or electrons\n- Cryotherapy — undertaken by an expert\n- Imiquimod cream — not yet fully evaluated.\n\nHowever, these treatments do not offer as high cure rates as complete surgical excision.\n\nBecause the risk of invasive melanoma is small, one option in very elderly patients with large lentigo maligna is to simply photograph and watch the lesion carefully, biopsying any areas suspicious of invasive disease because of clinical or dermoscopic change.\n\n"

If the lesion was invasive, regional lymph nodes should also be examined. It may be prudent to biopsy any lesion arising within or close to the excision site.\n\nThe risk of spread (metastatic melanoma) from invasive melanoma depends on several factors, but the main one is the thickness of the melanoma at the time it was surgically removed.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Guidelines report that metastases are rare for melanomas < 0.75mm and the risk for tumours 0.75–1 mm thick is about 5%. The risk steadily increases with thickness so that melanomas > 4 mm result in a 10-year survival of around 50%, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) statistics.\n\n"

A partial biopsy is not recommended, as it may miss an area of cancerous change.\n\n"

Wear a hat, long sleeves and a long skirt or trousers. Choose fabrics designed for the sun (UPF 40+) when outdoors.\n- Apply sunscreen to areas you can't cover. Choose broad-spectrum high protection (SPF 50+) sunscreens, applied frequently to exposed areas.\n\n"

The vesicles break easily to leave a bran-like scale.\n- Miliaria rubra, the most common form of heat rash, results in red, 2–4 mm, non-follicular papules and papulovesicles. They are very itchy. Background erythema is often present. In children, miliaria involves the trunk and the skin folds of the neck, axilla or groin. In adults, miliaria often affects the upper trunk, scalp, neck and flexures, particularly in areas of friction with clothing.\n- Miliaria pustulosa is a variant of miliaria rubra with pustules.\n- Miliaria profunda presents as asymptomatic deep papules.

        "content": "Melanoma, also referred to as malignant melanoma, is a potentially very serious skin cancer in which there is an uncontrolled growth of melanocytes (pigment cells).\n\nNormal melanocytes are found in the basal layer of the epidermis (outer layer of skin). Melanocytes produce a protein called melanin, which protects skin cells by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nNon-cancerous growth of melanocytes results in moles (benign melanocytic naevi) and freckles (ephelides and lentigines). In contrast, the cancerous growth of melanocytes results in melanoma. Melanoma is described as:\n\n- In situ, if a tumour is confined to the epidermis\n- Invasive, if a tumour has spread into the dermis\n- Metastatic, if a tumour has spread to other tissues.\n\nManagement of melanoma is rapidly evolving. For up-to-date recommendations for the diagnosis and management of melanoma, refer to local guidelines such as the Australian Cancer Council clinical practice guidelines.\n\nFor more images, please see links at the bottom of the page.\n\n"

        "content": "Australia and New Zealand have the highest reported incidence and mortality of melanoma globally. About 1 in 15-18 white-skinned Australians and New Zealanders are expected to develop melanoma in their lifetime. Melanoma is the third most common cancer in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2019, there were 2,727 melanoma registrations in New Zealand. There were 362 deaths from melanoma in 2016.\n\nMelanoma can occur in adults of any age but is very rare in children. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2021:\n\n- 7.9% of people diagnosed with melanoma were aged under 40 years\n- 10.7% were aged 40-49\n- 17.8% were aged 50-59\n- 23.9% were aged 60-69\n- 23.7% were aged 70-79\n- 16% were aged 80 or older.\n\nThe mean age for melanoma diagnosis is 65.7 years among men and 62.4 years among women. Melanoma is the most common cancer diagnosed in young Australians aged 15–29 years, accounting for 15% of all cancers in this age group.\n\nThe main risk factors for developing the more common type of melanoma (eg, superficial spreading melanoma) include:\n\n- Increasing age\n- Previous invasive melanoma or melanoma in situ\n- Previous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma\n- Many melanocytic naevi (moles)\n- Multiple (>5) atypical naevi (large or histologically dysplastic moles)\n- A strong family history of melanoma with two or more first-degree relatives affected\n- White/fair skin\n- Parkinson disease\n- UV exposure\n- History of sunburn\n- Weakened immune system or cancer-prone syndromes.\n\nThese risk factors are not as relevant to rarer types of melanoma.\n\nAlthough the presence of a large number of common nevi is a strong risk factor for cutaneous melanoma, the majority of melanomas arise de novo. A 2017 meta-analysis of 38 studies including over 20,000 melanomas found that only 29 percent were nevus-associated, with the rest arising de novo.\n\n"

        "content": "Melanoma is thought to begin as an uncontrolled proliferation of melanin-producing cells (melanocytic stem cells) that have undergone a genetic transformation.\n\nThe cause of these cell mutations can be acquired or inherited.\n\n- Acquired 'sporadic' mutations are the most common cause of cancer. They occur from damage to a cell during a person's life. The most common cause of melanoma is overexposure to UV radiation, eg, sun exposure, sunbed use.\n- Germline 'inherited' mutations are passed down from the parent. Inherited (familial) melanoma is far less common (<10%). CDKN2A (also called p16INK4A or MTS1) is the gene primarily linked in up to 20–40% of familial melanomas. However, in recent years, a growing number of other genes have been implicated, including CDK4, MC1R, MITF, TERT, ACD, BAP1, POT1, and TERF2IP.\n\nCutaneous melanoma can arise from otherwise normal-appearing skin (in about 75% of melanomas) or from within a pre-existing mole or freckle, which starts to grow larger and change in appearance. Precursor lesions include:\n\n- Benign melanocytic naevus (normal mole)\n- Atypical or dysplastic naevus (unusual-looking mole)\n- Atypical lentiginous junctional naevus (flat naevus in heavily sun-damaged skin) or atypical solar lentigo\n- Large or giant-sized congenital melanocytic naevus (brown birthmark).\n\nMelanomas have two growth phases, radial and vertical. Most melanomas arise as superficial tumours confined to the epidermis (ie, they have a horizontal growth phase; in situ). These generally grow slowly, but at any time, further genetic changes may cause the tumour to progress to the vertical growth phase, in which the malignant cells breach the basement membrane, invading deeper tissues, resulting in invasive melanoma.\n\nOnce the melanoma cells have reached the dermis, they may spread to other tissues via the lymphatic system to the local lymph nodes or via the bloodstream to other organs such as the lungs or brain. This is known as metastatic disease or secondary spread. The chance of this happening mainly depends on how deep the cells have penetrated the skin.\n\n"

Occasionally it occurs in other parts of the body such as the eye, brain, mouth or vagina.\n\nThe first sign of a melanoma is usually an unusual looking freckle or mole and may itch or bleed. Melanomas may grow across the skin (known as the radial growth phase) or grow in depth (known as the vertical growth phase).\n\nMelanoma may be detected at an early stage when it is only a few millimetres in diameter, but it may grow to several centimetres in diameter before it is diagnosed.\n\nA melanoma may have a variety of colours including:\n\n- Tan, dark brown, black, blue, red and, occasionally, light grey.\n- Melanomas that are lacking pigment are called amelanotic melanoma.\n- There may be areas of regression that are the colour of normal skin, or white and scarred.\n\nDuring its horizontal phase of growth, a melanoma is normally flat. As the vertical phase develops, the melanoma becomes thickened, raised, and palpable.\n\nSome melanomas are itchy or tender.

This may be supported by dermoscopy, confocal microscopy, total body photography (mole mapping), and adhesive patch genomic analysis, among other methods.\n\n- Dermoscopy — Some melanomas are extremely difficult to recognise clinically. The dermatoscopic appearance is helpful in the diagnosis of melanoma. Melanoma-specific criteria often include an atypical pigment network; brown-black dots/globules; multiple (5–6) colours asymmetrically distributed; blue-white veil; depigmentation; and irregular vascular pattern. Dermoscopy monitoring should only be considered for flat or slightly raised lesions, whereas any suspicious or nodular lesions should be excised.\n- Confocal Microscopy — Where available, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may be useful for clinical and dermoscopic examination of suspected melanoma lesions. RCM is a live imaging technology that allows for instant viewing of the epidermis and papillary dermis with nearly histologic resolution. Areas of higher melanin concentration appear as bright areas on a confocal image. This technology is especially useful for identifying amelanotic or hypomelanotic melanomas, mapping surgical margins pre-operatively, and monitoring lesions over time.\n- Photographic skin surveillance — Where available, total body photography (TBP), eg, MoleMap, should be considered for high-risk individuals, particularly those with high naevus counts and dysplastic naevi. TBP provides a baseline for monitoring new lesions and changes in pre-existing naevi. While not all changed lesions need to be excised, if there is clinical or dermoscopic evidence for melanoma at any point, excision is recommended.\n- Radiographic investigations — Imaging, such as CT or PET, may be appropriate for staging or surveillance of melanomas that are at significant risk for distant metastases.\n- Adhesive patch genomic analysis — skin surface tape stripping is a non-invasive test that can be used on pigmented lesions to obtain their genomic signature. It can be used to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma.\n\n"

Nail biopsy for suspected melanoma of the nail is discussed elsewhere.\n\nThe pathological diagnosis of melanoma can be very difficult. Immunohistochemical stains may help confirm melanoma and include S-100, SOX10, MART-1, HMB-45, MITF, tyrosinase and PRAME. Also, molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), may aid in diagnosis.\n\nIf there is invasive melanoma, the pathologist will comment on:\n\n- Diagnosis of primary melanoma\n- Breslow thickness—the Breslow thickness is reported for invasive melanomas to the nearest 0.1 mm. It is measured vertically in millimetres from the top of the granular layer (or base of superficial ulceration) to the deepest point of tumour involvement.

Nowadays in countries where measles is part of an immunisation programme, the risk of exposure and incidence of actual disease cases is low. A recent trend by some parents not to immunise their children has led to an increase in the number of cases of measles, and its complications.\n\nIn developing countries, measles still occurs frequently and is associated with a high rate of complications and death. It remains a common disease even in some developed countries of Europe and Asia.\n\nWHO reported a surge in cases worldwide in 2018, with nearly 10 million cases, and more than 140,000 deaths mostly in children under 5 years of age. The highest incidence rates were in the Ukraine, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Madagascar. The US reported its highest rate of infection in 25 years, and four countries in Europe lost their 'measles elimination' status.\n\n"

These are blue-white spots on the inside of the mouth opposite the molars, and occur 24–48 hours before the exanthem (rash) stage.\n- Prodromal symptoms usually last for 2–5 days but in some cases may persist for as long as 7–10 days.\n\n- Flat red spots ranging from 0.1–1.0cm in diameter appear on the 4th or 5th day following the start of symptoms.\n- This non-itchy rash begins on the face and behind the ears. Within 24–36 hours it spreads over the entire trunk and extremities (palms and soles rarely involved).\n- The spots may join together, especially in areas of the face.\n- The onset of the rash usually coincides with a high fever of at least 40C.\n- The rash begins to fade 3–4 days after it first appears. It fades first to a purplish hue and then to brown/coppery coloured lesions with fine scales.\n\n- A cough may persist for 1–3 weeks.\n- Measles-associated complications may be the cause of persisting fever beyond the 3rd day of the rash.\n\n"

Because the disease is now so rarely seen in developed countries, any suspected cases require laboratory confirmation. This is particularly useful in the following situations:\n\n- Sporadic cases\n- Atypical cases\n- Confusion with other diseases.\n\nAcute measles is usually confirmed on a viral nasopharyngeal or throat swab analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood and urine samples can also be used. This should be done within 5 days of onset of rash, however, positive results are sometimes obtained up to 10–14 days after the rash has resolved.\n\nBlood is also taken for measles IgM and IgG antibodies (serology). Levels of specific IgM become elevated during the active infection phase and IgG antibody appears during the recovery phase.\n\nViral culture of the throat and nasopharyngeal swabs is preferred in immunocompromised patients where serological evidence might be absent due to decreased immune response. An immunofluorescence test for measles antigen can also be considered in patients with poor immunity.\n\n"

WHO recommends a dose of 200,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A for two days, for reducing measles and its complications. A Cochrane Review found this reduced mortality and pneumonia-related mortality in children under the age of 2 years.\n- Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration.\n- Use a humidifier to provide relief from cough/sore throat.\n- Provide nutritional support as necessary.\n- Observe high-risk individuals carefully to prevent complications.\n\nPatients with drowsiness, dehydration, or discomfort breathing require hospitalisation for supportive care.\n\nAntibiotics are only needed to treat secondary bacterial infections such as otitis media, infectious diarrhoea, pneumonia, and sepsis.\n\nRibavirin (antiviral) is used to treat measles infection in immunocompromised patients and in those affected with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.\n\n"

Vaccination schedules recommend a two-dose immunisation strategy; the first dose at 12–15 months of age, followed by a second dose at 4–6 years.\n\nMeasles vaccine should not be given during pregnancy. Women not previously immunised against measles should avoid pregnancy for one month (28 days) after receiving the MMR vaccine.\n\nImmune globulin does not prevent measles, but it is helpful in decreasing the severity of illness in those exposed to the virus. It is recommended for:\n\n- Pregnant women\n- People with immune deficiency\n- Infants.\n\nIndividuals vaccinated prior to 1968 may require revaccination, as vaccines used before this time may not have conferred life-long immunity.\n\n"

Drugs can then be classified as unlikely or likely causes based on:\n\n- Time relative to onset of the rash\n- The specific drug; some drugs can be excluded as rarely causing allergy\n- Patient’s past experience with other drugs in the same class\n\nThere are no routine tests to make the diagnosis or to identify the culprit drug. Differential diagnosis includes measles, rubella, scarlet fever, non-specific toxic erythema associated with infection, Kawasaki disease, connective tissue disease and acute graft-versus-host disease.\n\nTests are not usually necessary if the cause has been identified and stopped, the rash is mild and the patient is well. They may include:\n\n- Routine blood count, liver and kidney function tests, C-reactive protein\n- Serology for infections that can cause similar rashes\n- Possible skin biopsy, which shows interface dermatitis, mixed perivascular infiltration and other histopathological features.\n\nEosinophilia is supportive but not diagnostic.

As babies start to eat solid foods, the stool frequency and pH start to increase and napkin dermatitis occurs more often.\n\nOther causes of napkin rashes include:\n\n- Candida albicans\n- Impetigo\n- Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis\n- Atopic eczema\n- Psoriasis\n- Miliaria\n- Acrodermatitis enteropathica\n- Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like conditions\n- Biotin responsive dermatosis\n- Rare disorders.\n\nNapkin dermatitis is not due to:\n\n- Allergy to the napkins\n- Toxins in the napkins\n- Washing powders (unless these are not thoroughly removed by rinsing)\n- Dermatophyte fungal infections (tinea).\n\n"

Avoid plastic overpants.\n\nAt napkin changes:\n\n- Gently clean the baby’s skin with water and a soft cloth\n- Wet wipes are convenient but expensive and can lead to contact allergy to preservatives used to stop them going mouldy\n- Aqueous cream or another non-soap cleanser can be used if necessary\n- Pat dry gently and allow to air dry\n- Apply a protective emollient ointment containing petrolatum and zinc oxide.\n\n"

After the culture is reported, the choice is adjusted.\n- It is absolutely vital that an experienced surgeon urgently removes all necrotic tissue (debridement).\n- Supplemental oxygen, fluids, and medicines may be needed to raise blood pressure.\n- Hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin may also be considered.\n\nImmediate surgical debridement improves survival and avoids complications of necrotising fasciitis. All infected tissue should be cleared away using adequate excision. Repeated debridements are carried out for a few days.\n\nWhen the acute infection has subsided, the wound should be closed with skin grafting if required.

The study concluded that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotinamide might have contributed to its success in acne.\n\nNicotinamide also reduces facial sebum production. Sebum is responsible for facial shine and contributes to noninflamed comedones and inflammatory acne lesions. Results of a well-controlled clinical trial in Caucasian and Japanese women have shown that application of 2% nicotinamide moisturiser to the face for 4-6 weeks reduces sebum production with significant differences in facial shine and oiliness.\n\nNicotinamide gel is marketed as an over-the-counter treatment for acne in Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, USA and Ireland.

These co-enzymes play a role in the metabolism of glucose, cellular energy production, and synthesis of lipids. The levels of NADH / NADPH (the reduced forms of NAD and NADP) decrease with age and topical nicotinamide appears to reverse the decline.\n\nIn multiple clinical studies, topical nicotinamide improved fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmented spots, red blotchiness, and skin sallowness (yellowing) as well as elasticity. One study showed nicotinamide to increase the skin's production of ceramides, which are natural emollients and skin protectants, thus improving skin hydration.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face, left-right, randomised 12-week study in 50 women evaluated the effects of 5% topical nicotinamide on various signs of skin ageing. The researchers reported topical nicotinamide resulted in significant improvement in fine lines/wrinkles, pigmentation, texture and red blotchiness. The study was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAnother study of 30 healthy Japanese females reported improvement of eyelid wrinkles after eight weeks of application of a cosmetic containing 4% nicotinamide.\n\nNicotinamide is well tolerated and often can be used by those who cannot tolerate topical retinoids or fruit acids.\n\n"

This in turn leads to bacterial overgrowth.\n\nCommon causes that encourage bacterial overgrowth in the external ear include:\n\n- Increased water exposure from swimming, perspiration, and high humidity\n- Trauma to the ear canal eg, from scratching or insertion of foreign objects such as cotton buds.\n\nThe most common bacteria involved in otitis externa are Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (15%).

Pruritus may be quite intense, resulting in scratching and further irritation.\n- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n\n- Usually intensely itchy.\n- Typically part of a more generalised skin involvement, including the external ears, face, and neck.\n- The skin may become red, thickened, crusty, and hyperpigmented from scratching.\n\n- Commonly associated with scalp involvement but rarely facial involvement.\n- Raised, red lesions with thick silvery-white adherent scale.\n- Often itchy.\n\n- Occurs suddenly.\n- Red, swollen, itchy and exuding lesions.\n- The external auditory canal may react to allergens that do not cause a reaction elsewhere.\n- May affect the outer ear and lobe and extend onto the upper neck.\n\n- Slower onset than allergic contact dermatitis.\n- Lesions are usually patches of thickened, hardened skin.\n- May affect the outer ear and lobe.\n\n"

Drops are usually administered 3–4 times a day for 5–7 days but depend on the product used and clinical presentation. More severe infections may require 10–14 days of treatment.\n\nTopical aminoglycosides, acetic acid solutions, and polymyxins are contraindicated in those with a non-intact tympanic membrane, due to reports of ototoxicity.\n\nIn those with marked swelling of the ear canal, an ear wick moistened with antibiotic drops may be placed in the ear canal to help reduce swelling and improve the delivery of ear drops.\n\nOral antimicrobials are generally not indicated unless there is evidence of extension of the infection beyond the ear canal, immunocompromise, or suspected malignant otitis externa.\n\nOther measures may include:\n\n- Optimising management of any primary or systemic skin conditions, which may include emollients and topical steroids\n- Avoiding irritants or allergens that may contribute to contact dermatitis.\n\n"

It involves cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which attack the oral epithelial cells — resulting in their death. The immune response is mediated by antigen-specific cells.\n\nIn most cases oral lichen planus is idiopathic, when the reaction is thought to be against autoantigens. In other cases, it may be precipitated by exogenous antigens described below.\n\n- Drugs — this is called oral lichenoid drug reaction. It is most often due to gold therapy. Other medications include some antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antimalarials, drugs used for treating hypertension and heart disease, and antiretroviral medicines. These drugs more commonly cause a lichenoid skin eruption, with the mouth being affected less often.\n- Contact allergens in dental restorative materials (mercury, nickel, gold, resins, acrylates) or toothpaste, particularly spearmint. These may be identified by careful patch testing.\n- Viral infection, particularly Hepatitis C\n\nOral lichenoid lesions are also part of the spectrum of chronic graft-versus-host disease that occurs after bone marrow transplantation.\n\nStudies have demonstrated a lower serum vitamin D level in those with oral lichen planus compared to control groups.\n\n"

It is usually the same colour as the rest of the mouth lining but is sometimes paler or, if it has bled, may look a dark colour. The surface may be ulcerated due to trauma, or become rough and scaly. It is usually dome-shaped but may be on a short stalk like a polyp (pedunculated). If it has developed under a denture it may be flat with a leaf-like shape.\n\nThe commonest location for an oral fibroma is on the inside of the cheek where the upper and lower teeth meet. Other common sites include the sides of the tongue, gums and inside the lower lip.\n\nApart from the feel and appearance, oral fibromas do not cause any symptoms. Oral fibromas develop over weeks or months to reach a maximum size usually about 1 cm in diameter, but can sometimes be larger.\n\nAn oral fibroma is usually a solitary lesion. When there are many lesions, associated diagnoses need to be considered including tuberous sclerosis, Cowden syndrome, familial fibromatosis and fibrotic papillary hyperplasia of the palate.\n\nOral fibromas do not develop into oral cancer.\n\n"

While some bacteria can cause infection in normal heart valves, bacterial endocarditis more commonly affects patients with abnormal valves as a result of previous rheumatic fever, valve surgery/replacement, or congenital abnormalities.\n\nThe responsible bacteria include various species of staphylococcus, streptococcus, pseudomonas, bartonella and several other organisms.\n\nBacterial endocarditis is often divided into ‘acute’ and ‘subacute’ varieties depending on the speed that it progresses. The symptoms may include fever, lethargy, shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations. These symptoms require prompt assessment and investigation by a physician.\n\nSplinter haemorrhage in the proximal nail plate is also a sign of bacterial endocarditis.\n\n"

His first description of these lesions was in 1893. Sir William Osler, a Canadian-born Physician, wrote 1344 publications on a wide range of medical topics.\n\n"

It has been postulated that early biopsies show bacteria within the microabscesses and as time progresses, the nodes become sterile and hypersensitivity vasculitis or small vessel vasculitis develops, mediated by the immune system.\n\n"

        "content": "Orf mainly infects young lambs and goats who contract the infection from one another or possibly from persistence of the virus in the pastures or sheds. The disease is called contagious pustular dermatitis or scabby mouth in the animal because it forms crusts and scabs around nose, mouth, teats and elsewhere. As it reduces suckling, the animal can lose weight. The disease lasts about six weeks. It is highly contagious, so several animals in the herd may be infected.\n\nWho gets orf?\n\nHuman lesions are caused by direct inoculation of infected material, often through an existing scratch or cut.\n\nOrf is a risk for sheep farmers, shearers, freezing workers, or anyone that bottle-feeds a lamb. Children may also acquire it from playing on infected pasture or in a sheep shed. Butchers, meat porters and housewives are sometimes infected from carcasses, especially sheep heads.\n\nHuman orf has been reported after accidental contact with orf virus vaccine intended for the animals.\n\nIt is not usually transmitted from human to human, although this has been rarely reported.\n\nWhat are the clinical features of orf?\n\nOrf lesions are generally solitary or few in number. They occur most commonly on the fingers, hands or forearms but can appear on the face.\n\nAfter an incubation period of 5–6 days, a small, firm, red or reddish-blue lump enlarges to form a flat-topped, blood-tinged pustule or blister. The fully developed lesion is usually 2–3 cm in diameter but may be as large as 5 cm. Characteristically, although there appears to be pus under the white skin, incising this will reveal firm, red tissue underneath. The orf lesion is sometimes irritable during the early stages and is often tender.\n\nRed streaks up the lymph channels (lymphangitis) with enlargement of the lymph glands on the inner side of the elbow and/or under the arm (lymphadenopathy) are not uncommon. There may be a mild fever.\n\nSee more images of orf ...\n\n"

It results in targetoid macules, plaques and blisters on the hands and feet, face, arms and legs. Less distinctive red rashes, 'toxic erythemas' also occur, and rarely the blistering disorder,  pemphigoid.\n\n"

Vaccination of the herd using a live virus is recommended if there is a significant outbreak of orf. The vaccine causes a mild orf scab to develop at the vaccination site and should not be used in healthy herds where there is no history of orf. Vaccinated animals should be kept separate from unvaccinated animals until the scab has healed. Sheds should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.\n\n"

The most common species cultured from pityriasis versicolor are M globosa, M restricta and M sympodialis.\n\nUsually malassezia grow sparsely in the seborrhoeic areas (scalp, face and chest) without causing a rash. It is not known why they sometimes grow more actively on the skin surface to form pityriasis versicolor. One theory implicates a tryptophan-dependent metabolic pathway.\n\nThe yeasts induce enlarged melanosomes (pigment granules) within basal melanocytes in the brown type of pityriasis versicolor. It is easier to demonstrate the yeasts in scrapings taken from this type of pityriasis versicolor than in those taken from the white type.\n\nThe white or hypopigmented type of pityriasis versicolor is thought to be due to a chemical produced by malassezia that diffuses into the epidermis and impairs the function of the melanocytes.\n\nThe pink type of pityriasis versicolor is mildly inflamed, due to dermatiits induced by malassezia or its metabolites.\n\n"

Pale patches may be more common in darker skin; this appearance is known as pityriasis versicolor alba. Sometimes the patches start scaly and brown, and then resolve through a non-scaly and white stage.\n\nPityriasis versicolor is usually asymptomatic, but in some people it is mildly itchy.\n\nIn general, pale or dark patches due to pityriasis versicolor do not tend to be more or less prone to sunburn than surrounding skin.\n\nHyperpigmented, hypopigmented, and pink pityriasis versicolor are usually seen as distinct variants but may sometimes co-exist. Pink pityriasis versicolor may also co-exist with seborrhoeic dermatitis as both are associated with malassezia overgrowth.\n\nSee more images of pityriasis versicolor.\n\n"

This major histocompatibility complex is not associated with psoriatic arthritis, nail psoriasis, or late-onset psoriasis.\n\nImmune factors and inflammatory cytokines (messenger proteins) such as IL1β and TNFα, IL-23, and IL-17 are responsible for the clinical features of psoriasis. These have therefore become targets for biological drugs and have led to success in drug management.\n\n"

The scale is typically silvery white, except in skin folds where the plaques often appear shiny with a moist peeling surface. The most common sites are the scalp, elbows, and knees, but any part of the skin can be involved. The plaques are usually very persistent without treatment.\n\nItch is mostly mild but may be severe in some patients, leading to scratching and lichenification characterised by thickened leathery skin and increased skin markings. Painful skin cracks or fissures may occur, particularly on the palms and soles.\n\nPsoriasis can demonstrate the Koebner phenomenon. This involves the generation of new lesions on the skin that has been damaged or irritated such as by injury, burns etc.\n\nWhen psoriatic plaques clear up, they may leave brown or pale marks (postinflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation) that can be expected to fade over several months.\n\nAuspitz sign refers to pinpoint bleeding upon removal of the scaly layer in plaque psoriasis. It is related to the dilated dermal capillaries involved in the histological pathogenesis of chronic psoriasis.\n\n"

The most common sites involved are the fingers and face. Pyogenic granuloma easily bleeds with minor trauma.\n\nOral mucosal pyogenic granulomas typically develop on the lip and gums (gingiva) as pedunculated or sessile slow-growing painless red papules ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. The surface can be ulcerated with a yellow-fibrinous surface, and easy bleeding. With time, the lesion becomes a paler pink colour.

It involves applying appropriately diluted allergens to the skin, usually on the back for convenience, for 48 hours. The patch tests are then read at 96 hours as reactions usually take 48–96 hours to develop. Positive reactions produce a patch of dermatitis at the application site of the offending allergen, which will appear as a red and possibly raised, vesicular and even blistering area.\n\nDermatitis can be thought of as being exogenous (eg, irritants, allergens, and sometimes light) or endogenous. In practice, dermatitis may be of mixed cause. Patch testing is largely of value in determining the cause of allergic contact dermatitis, and is not useful in investigating irritant dermatitis. Patch testing has some limited value in investigating some types of drug allergy, and a specialised type of patch testing is used for investigating photo contact allergy (photopatch testing).\n\nRepeat open application testing can sometimes help identify a suspect item (usually a personal care product) if there is a delay in formal patch testing — the product is applied twice a day to a 5 cm diameter area of forearm skin for 5­–10 days. No visible redness or swelling means contact allergy to that product is unlikely. Some highly irritant products cannot safely be repeat open or occluded patch tested, as they may require appropriate dilution.\n\nPatch tests are not the same as skin prick tests, which are used to diagnose hay fever allergy.\n\n"

Anywhere between 30 and over a hundred allergens can be applied at a time. Ideally the patch tests are applied when the dermatitis is inactive, but if the back skin is inflamed, the arms or abdominal skin can be used for application. After carefully marking the position of the patch test panels, they are removed at 48 hours, and the skin inspected 48 hours after that.\n\nDuring patch testing, it is best to:\n\n- Be taking less than 10 mg of oral prednisolone a day\n- Not be on an immunosuppressive agent that will reduce the reaction\n- Avoid potent topical steroids to the application site for three days before patch testing is commenced\n- Avoid bathing or showering the test area which will wash off the panels or the identification marking\n- Avoid excessive exercise that may dislodge the allergen tapes.\n\nAntihistamines can be taken as normal as they do not interfere with the type IV hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n"

The composition of the series varies over time and from country to country, as different allergens may become more or less important. The baseline series will pick up about 70% of contact dermatitis.\n\nAdditional series of allergens may be applied, according to:\n\n- Occupation eg, hairdressers, bakers, dentists\n- Site of dermatitis eg, facial, lower leg, vulval, perianal, feet\n- Suspected allergen exposure eg, acrylates, epoxy resins, plastics and glues textile dyes and resins, medicaments, topical steroids\n- Patients own products eg, cosmetics, moisturisers, nail varnish, topical medicaments, gloves; these may need to be diluted to the correct patch testing strength.\n\nAt a pre-patch test consultation, the series of allergens required are selected. This is important so that potential allergens are not missed, and any product dilution arranged.\n\nIt is helpful to bring health and safety data sheets and product packaging (which may list individual allergen ingredients). If there is a suspicious product that may be the cause of dermatitis, it is important this is brought along to the doctors appointment. Patch testing may be required and its packaging will contain valuable details of its constituents.\n\n"

The colour can be removed with an alcohol swab and these are not to be confused with true positive reactions.\n\nIrritant reactions can occur in those with atopic eczema, particularly to metals (nickel, chromate and cobalt), perfumes and some rubber accelerators, and are not relevant.\n\nNegative results may mean that the dermatitis is endogenous or irritant in cause, or perhaps the allergen may have been missed (not considered or tested for, or may even be a novel allergen).\n\nPositive reactions are, if possible, then interpreted as being of:\n\n- Current relevance — the reaction can explain dermatitis that is currently being investigated\n- Past relevance — the history reveals a past allergic dermatitis but does not explain the current episode\n- Future relevance — the allergen is likely to be encountered in the future\n- Uncertain relevance — this may change when the patient finds the identified allergen after scrutinising their personal care or occupational products\n- Potential cross reaction — eg, positive reaction to the hair dye allergen PPD may result in some people reacting to parabens (in cosmetics and sunscreens) or textile dyes.\n\nDetailed information sheets can be given for many of the allergens which will guide patients as to where they may find, and therefore avoid, the identified allergen. It is useful to make a note of identified allergens for checking products when shopping. Most countries mandate that allergen constituents appear within or on the packaging or several types of product, particularly personal care items. The print can be very small, and cosmetic manufacturer’s websites usually list constituents, are up to date and easier to read.\n\n"

Although rosacea is often thought to affect women more than men, studies have revealed an approximately equal gender distribution.\n\nRosacea typically presents after the age of 30 and becomes more prevalent with age. However, it can occur at any age and occasionally presents in children. Although rosacea can affect anyone, it is more common in those with fair skin, blue eyes, and those of Celtic or North European descent. It may be more difficult and under-recognised in patients with skin of colour.\n\nRosacea has been associated with depression, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, anxiety disorder, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, ulcerative colitis, and dementia.\n\n"

UV radiation can damage the dermis and increase skin inflammation.\n\n"

Non-specific symptoms include:\n\n- Fever\n- Abdominal pain\n- Muscle aches\n\nARF causes a variety of more specific clinical features:\n\n- Polyarthritis (multiple inflamed joints) — Most often ankles, knees, elbows, wrists. Arthritis can migrate from one joint to another.\n- Carditis (inflammation of the heart) – This involves the heart valves, heart muscle, and membrane surrounding the heart.\n- Sydenham chorea – This is a disorder of the nervous system characterised by personality changes, muscle weakness, and involuntary movements.\n\nSkin signs in ARF may include:\n\n- Erythema marginatum rheumaticum – This is a characteristic type of annular erythema that occurs in about 10% of first attacks of ARF in children; it is very rare in adults. The rash can be difficult to detect in dark-skinned people. When present, it is found on the trunk and upper arms and legs, but almost never on the face, palms or soles. The rash appears as pink or red macules (flat spots) or papules (small lumps), which spread outwards in a circular shape. As the lesions advance, the edges become raised and red, and the centre clears. The lesions are not itchy or painful, and sometimes go unnoticed by the patient. The lesions can fade and reappear within hours, reappearing in hot conditions. Erythema marginatum may persist intermittently for weeks to months, even after successful treatment of ARF.\n- Subcutaneous nodules (small lumps under the skin) – These are uncommon, occurring in less than 2% of patients with ARF. The painless nodules are found over joints (such as the elbows, knees, ankles, and knuckles), the back of the scalp, and the vertebrae (backbone). The nodules are firm, round, mobile, and range from 0.5-2 cm in size. The nodules are usually only found when severe carditis is present. They usually resolve within one month but may persist for longer.\n\n"

A detailed explanation of these criteria (and modifications for the New Zealand environment) can be found on the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand website.\n\nTests to confirm evidence of a group A streptococcal infection include:\n\n- Blood tests to look for elevated or rising antibodies to group A streptococcus. The most commonly used tests are the plasma antistreptolysin O and the antideoxyribonuclease B titres.\n- Culture of throat swabs and rapid antigen tests for group A streptococcus are less accurate.\n\nOther tests used in the assessment of a patient with suspected ARF include:\n\n- Blood tests – markers of inflammation, such as ESR or CRP, may be raised\n- Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram to identify heart involvement\n- Doppler and colour flow mapping to detect minor valvular defects not evident clinically\n\n"

Continuous penicillin is also recommended for people with established rheumatic heart disease. Continuous penicillin is generally given by injection every four weeks for a minimum of 10 years. Some patients, such as those with severe carditis, may require lifelong treatment.\n\nAspirin or naproxen are added to reduce inflammation, fever and pain. In extreme cases, a corticosteroid such as prednisone may be added.\n\nPatients with rheumatic heart disease may occasionally require heart surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.\n\n"

Fissuring can occur at the first attempt at sexual intercourse or many years later, in women who have had children or who have never had children. They may also have other symptoms, including fissures in the skin folds elsewhere in the vulva.\n\nOn careful clinical examination, there is usually a tiny split or linear erosion at the midline of the base of the vagina on the perineal skin. Colposcopy may be necessary to see the fissure. The posterior fourchette may form a tight band or tent (membranous hypertrophy). In some cases, signs may be more impressive and include:\n\n- Marked tenderness\n- Deep, wide ulceration\n- Redness of surrounding tissue\n- Swelling or lumps\n- Scarring.\n\nThe vulva may appear entirely normal if the examination takes place after the fissure has healed.

Cold weather and skin trauma typically trigger or aggravate the skin lesions.\n\nMicrovascular insufficiency and elevated fibronectin levels in plasma, as seen with diabetes and renal failure, may play a role in the acquired form. Another theory suggests microdeposition of substances and abnormal glycosylation of collagen I and III in diabetes alter collagen fibres.\n\nSuperficial trauma, such as scratching, and cold leads to necrobiosis and epidermal thinning in susceptible patients.\n\n"

The hands are most often affected, but it sometimes involves the feet and occasionally the nipples, nasal tip, or earlobes.\n\nTypically, one or more fingers will turn white and numb and, on rewarming, blue due to a sluggish blood flow. This is sometimes followed by a bright red colour and swelling due to a compensatory increase in blood flow before the normal skin colour and sensation are restored.\n\nAttacks may be painful and can last from minutes to hours.\n\nRaynaud phenomenon of the nipples presents as breast pain, often associated with pregnancy or lactation. It may follow breast surgery. Typically it presents as extremely painful or throbbing breastfeeding precipitated by exposure to cold, and the usual sequential two or three colour phases of blanching, blueness and/or erythema.\n\n"

Serological blood tests can also predict the chance of developing a connective tissue disease in the future.\n\nA history and thorough examination, including nail fold capillaroscopy, should be undertaken to determine if symptoms are due to primary or secondary Raynaud phenomenon.

The dose may be gradually increased if necessary.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is also known as seborrhoeic eczema (“seborrheic” in American English).\n\nDandruff (also called ‘pityriasis capitis’) is an uninflamed form of seborrhoeic dermatitis on the scalp. Dandruff presents as diffuse bran-like scaly patches within hair-bearing areas of the scalp without underlying erythema. Dandruff may be asymptomatic or mildly pruritic.\n\nClick here for more images\n\n"

Prevalence is greatest in young adults and in older people. It is more common in males than in females.\n\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis often occurs in otherwise healthy patients. However, the following factors are sometimes associated with severe adult seborrhoeic dermatitis:\n\n- Oily skin (seborrhea)\n- Familial tendency to seborrhoeic dermatitis or a family history of psoriasis\n- Immunosuppression: organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and patients with lymphoma\n- Neurological and psychiatric diseases: Parkinson’s disease, tardive dyskinesia, depression, epilepsy, facial nerve palsy, spinal cord injury, and congenital disorders such as Down syndrome\n- Use of neuroleptic medications\n- Treatment for psoriasis with psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy\n- Lack of sleep, and stressful events.\n\n"

Note, some strains of Malassezia are resistant to azole antifungals. Try zinc pyrithione or selenium sulphide.\n- Mild topical corticosteroids: for 1–3 weeks to reduce the inflammation of an acute flare.\n- Topical calcineurin inhibitors: (pimecrolimus cream, tacrolimus ointment) are indicated if topical corticosteroids are needing to be used frequently, as they have fewer adverse effects on facial skin with long term use.\n\nIn resistant cases in adults, oral itraconazole, tetracycline antibiotics, or phototherapy may be recommended. Low-dose oral isotretinoin has also been shown to be effective for severe or moderate disease.\n\nRoflumilast 0.3% foam has had recent FDA approval for the use of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients aged 9 years and older.\n\n- Medicated shampoos containing ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, and salicylic acid, used twice weekly for at least a month and if necessary, indefinitely.\n- Steroid scalp applications reduce itching and should be applied daily for a few days every so often.\n- Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus can be used as steroid alternatives.\n- Coal tar cream can be applied to scaling areas and removed several hours later by shampooing.\n- Combination therapy is often advisable.\n- Alternative treatments, such as tea tree oil shampoo, may be used.\n\n- Cleanse the affected skin thoroughly once or twice each day using a non-soap cleanser.\n- Apply ketoconazole or ciclopirox cream once daily for 2 to 4 weeks, repeated as necessary.\n- Hydrocortisone cream can also be used, applied up to twice daily for 1 or 2 weeks. Occasionally a more potent topical steroid may be prescribed.\n- Topical calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus cream or tacrolimus ointment may be used instead of topical steroids.\n- A variety of herbal remedies are commonly used, but their efficacy is uncertain.\n\nRegular washing of the scalp with baby shampoo or aqueous cream is followed by gentle brushing to clear the scales.\n\n- White petrolatum may be useful.\n- Topical antifungal agents are often prescribed, depending on the extent of the rash.\n\nFor more information, see infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n\n"

As time goes by, seborrhoeic keratoses become more numerous. Some people inherit a tendency to develop a very large number of them. Researchers have noted:\n\n- Eruptive seborrhoeic keratoses can follow sunburn or dermatitis.\n- Skin friction may be the reason they appear in body folds.\n- Viral cause (eg human papillomavirus) seems unlikely.\n- Stable and clonal mutations or activation of FRFR3, PIK3CA, RAS, AKT1 and EGFR genes are found in seborrhoeic keratoses.\n- Seborrhoeic keratosis can arise from solar lentigo.\n- FRFR3 mutations also arise in solar lentigines. These mutations are associated with increased age and location on the head and neck, suggesting a role of ultraviolet radiation in these lesions.\n- Seborrhoeic keratoses do not harbour tumour suppressor gene mutations.\n- Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (used to treat cancer) often result in an increase in verrucal (warty) keratoses.\n\n"

Scabies is more common in the elderly, children, and adolescents.\n\nThe burden of disease is higher in low-income areas, in the tropics, and in poorly resourced communities and countries.\n\nRisk factors for scabies, particularly in developing countries, include:\n\n- Crowded conditions\n- Poor hygiene\n- Poverty\n- Malnutrition\n- Homelessness\n- Immunodeficiency.\n\nIn developed countries, scabies occurs in family outbreaks and children may acquire it from close play contact in school or sleepovers. In situations where there may be close physical contact for the delivery of personal care, such as in care homes, large outbreaks are not uncommon. In young adults, sexual spread is frequent.\n\n"

They migrate to the skin surface, and the cycle continues.\n- The itchy rash is the result of a TH1-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to various mite-related antigens and is thus delayed.\n\n"

Stigma can lead to an inability to ensure household or sexual contacts are treated.\n- Sleep disturbance and an unsightly rash compound the emotional impact of the illness, especially where diagnosis and comprehensive treatment is delayed, when the symptoms can persist for many months.\n\n"

In crusted scabies, dermoscopy may show hyperkeratosis.\n\nFor information on trichoscopic findings in scabies of the scalp, see Trichoscopy of scalp infestations.\n- For information on trichoscopic findings in scabies of the scalp, see Trichoscopy of scalp infestations.\n- Skin scrapings using either a blade or needle allow direct visualisation of mites eggs or mite faeces on microscopy. Visualisation of a live mite by the patient galvanises treatment concordance.\n- A burrow ink test may reveal a classical zig-zag line where the ink has tracked into a burrow.\n- Adhesive tape test is used to transfer a sample from a suspicious lesion directly to a microscope slide.\n- Skin biopsy, although rarely necessary, will show eggs, larvae, faeces, and mites.\n\nIt is useful to examine close contacts in suspicious cases as pathognomonic signs are often seen in those with minimal symptoms.\n\nThe International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) updated consensus criteria for the diagnosis of scabies in 2020, copied below:\n\n"

Reapplication is needed if hands are washed during the treatment period. Infants, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed should also treat the face and scalp.\n- Application should include under the nails and between the toes.\n- Treatment should be repeated after 7–10 days.\n- If the case is permethrin-resistant, or permethrin is not available, alternative insecticides, include 10–25% benzyl benzoate or 0.5% malathion aqueous lotion.\n- Spinosad is a topical horticultural insecticide and is effective against scabies where it is available.\n\n- Oral ivermectin is indicated in cases of topical failure, inability to comply with topical therapy, non-adherence to topical therapy, institutional outbreaks, mass treatment of populations, and crusted scabies.\n- Repeat dose after 2 weeks.\n- Latest data suggests oral ivermectin is equally as effective as topical 5% permethrin cream or lotion, however may be slower-acting.\n- According to French dermatology guidance (2024), ivermectin may be an option for children over the age of 2 months. It can also be used in breastfeeding women and during pregnancy from the second trimester onwards, if topical therapies have proved ineffective.\n- Oral moxidectin is as yet unlicensed, but an effective agent that has good skin retention — it may be effective as a single treatment and prevent re-infestation.\n\n- Provide written instruction.\n- Explain the necessity for complete, contemporaneous compliance with topical therapy.\n- Household members should elect an early, convenient evening on which to be treated, assemble bedding and clothing for laundry, and apply the topical treatment before dressing and remaking beds.\n- Itching may last for several weeks, and this does not represent persistent infection or treatment failure.\n\n- May persist for weeks\n- Moderate potency topical steroids may be used and required for 3–4 weeks, particularly if the patient has a widespread eczematous reaction\n- Antihistamines are helpful in some cases\n- Emollient use and soap avoidance should be advised\n- Persistent nodules may need potent topical or intralesional steroids.\n\n- 5% permethrin cream or lotion is considered safe in pregnancy and while lactating.\n- Alternative topical preparations include sulphur 5–10% cream, ointment, or lotion.\n- Oral ivermectin is not advised during pregnancy.\n\n"

It results from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which causes local proliferation of melanocytes and accumulation of melanin within the skin cells (keratinocytes). Solar lentigos or lentigines are very common, especially in people over the age of 40 years. Sometimes they are also known as an “old age spot” or “senile freckle”.\n\n"

        "content": "A solar lentigo is a flat, well-circumscribed patch. It can be round, oval or irregular in shape. Colour varies from skin-coloured, tan to dark brown or black, and size varies from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. They can be slightly scaly.\n\nSolar lentigines are found as groups of similar lesions on sun-exposed sites, particularly the face or the back of hands. They occur in light and dark skin, but tend to be more numerous in fair-skinned individuals.\n\nSee more images of solar lentigines.\n\n"

        "content": "Solar lentigo is often diagnosed on its clinical appearance. On occasion, it can be difficult to differentiate an irregular solar lentigo from melanoma, a potentially dangerous form of skin cancer, and the term atypical solar lentigo may be used.\n\nExamination using dermatoscopy can clarify the diagnosis. If there is still diagnostic doubt, a skin biopsy may be performed for histological examination.\n\n"

This results in localised thickening and change in texture within the lentigo.\n\nSolar lentigines may become inflamed, when they are called lichenoid keratoses or lichen-planus like keratoses (due to the pattern of inflammation seen on histopathology). Lichenoid keratoses gradually disappear.\n\n"

Cryotherapy and laser surgery can destroy them, but treatment may leave a temporary or permanent white or dark mark.\n\nCysteamine cream hyperpigmentation treatment has been used. Bleaching agents such as hydroquinone are not effective.\n\nPreventative measures include minimizing sun exposure and use of sunscreens, but this needs to start early in life.\n\n"

This is determined by constitutional colour (white, brown, or black skin) and the effect of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (tanning). Pale or white skin burns easily and tans slowly and poorly: it needs more protection against sun exposure. Darker skin burns less and tans more easily. It is also more prone to develop postinflammatory pigmentation after injury (brown marks).\n\nFitzpatrick skin phototype is a constitutional characteristic present at birth. Note that people with photosensitivity may burn easily on exposure to the sun due to a disease, condition, or medication; however, their tanning ability is not influenced by their photosensitivity.\n\n"

A half-life of a medication is the time that half of the delivered dose remains circulating in the body.\n- The medications are usually systemic (taken by mouth or injection), but TEN has been reported after topical use.\n- No drug is implicated in about 20% of cases\n- SJS/TEN has rarely been associated with vaccination and infections such as mycoplasma and cytomegalovirus. Infections are generally associated with mucosal involvement and less severe cutaneous disease than when drugs are the cause.\n\nThe drugs that most commonly cause SJS/TEN are antibiotics in 40%. Other drugs include:\n\n- Sulfonamides: cotrimoxazole\n- Beta-lactam: penicillins, cephalosporins\n- Anti-convulsants: lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone\n- Allopurinol\n- Paracetamol/acetaminophen\n- Nevirapine (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)\n- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (oxicam type mainly)\n- The anticancer drugs, PD-1 inhibitors.\n\nOther triggers of SJS/TEN.\n\n"

The mechanism has still not been understood and is complex.\n\nDrug-specific CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes can be detected in the early blister fluid. They have some natural killer cell activity and can probably kill keratinocytes by direct contact. Cytokines implicated include perforin/granzyme, granulysin, Fas-L and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα).\n\nThere are probably two major pathways involved:\n\n- Fas-Fas ligand pathway of apoptosis has been considered a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of TEN. The Fas ligand (FasL), a form of tumour necrosis factor, is secreted by blood lymphocytes and can bind to the Fas ‘death’ receptor expressed by keratinocytes.\n- Granule-mediated exocytosis via perforin and granzyme B resulting in cytotoxicity (cell death). Perforin and granzyme B can be detected in early blister fluid, and it has been suggested that levels may be associated with disease severity.\n\n"

For most drugs, the onset is within a few days up to 1 month.\n\nBefore the rash appears, there is usually a prodromal illness of several days duration resembling an upper respiratory tract infection or 'flu-like illness. Symptoms may include:\n\n- Fever > 39 C\n- Sore throat, difficulty swallowing\n- Runny nose and cough\n- Sore red eyes, conjunctivitis\n- General aches and pains.\n\nThere is then an abrupt onset of a tender/painful red skin rash starting on the trunk and extending rapidly over hours to days onto the face and limbs (but rarely affecting the scalp, palms or soles). The maximum extent is usually reached by four days.\n\nThe skin lesions may be:\n\n- Macules — flat, red and diffuse (measles-like spots) or purple (purpuric) spots\n- Diffuse erythema\n- Targetoid — as in erythema multiforme\n- Blisters — flaccid (ie, not tense).\n\nThe blisters then merge to form sheets of skin detachment, exposing red, oozing dermis. The Nikolsky sign is positive in areas of skin redness. This means that blisters and erosions appear when the skin is rubbed gently.\n\nMucosal involvement is prominent and severe, although not forming actual blisters. At least two mucosal surfaces are affected including:\n\n- Eyes (conjunctivitis, less often corneal ulceration, anterior uveitis, panophthalmitis) — red, sore, sticky, photosensitive eyes\n- Lips/mouth (cheilitis, stomatitis) — red crusted lips, painful mouth ulcers\n- Pharynx, oesophagus — causing difficulty eating\n- Genital area and urinary tract — erosions, ulcers, urinary retention\n- Upper respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi) — cough and respiratory distress\n- Gastrointestinal tract — diarrhoea.\n\nThe patient is very ill, extremely anxious and in considerable pain.

The direct immunofluorescence test on the skin biopsy is negative, indicating the disease is not due to deposition of antibodies in the skin.\n\nBlood tests do not help to make the diagnosis but are essential to make sure fluid and vital nutrients have been replaced, to identify complications and to assess prognostic factors (see below). Abnormalities may include:\n\n- Anaemia occurs in virtually all cases (reduced haemoglobin).\n- Leucopenia (reduced white cells), especially lymphopenia (reduced lymphocytes) is very common (90%).\n- Neutropenia (reduced neutrophils), if present, is a bad prognostic sign.\n- Eosinophilia (raised eosinophil count) and atypical lymphocytosis (odd-looking lymphocytes) do not occur.\n- Mildly raised liver enzymes are common (30%), and approximately 10% develop overt hepatitis.\n- Mild proteinuria (protein leaking into the urine) occurs in about 50%.

Some clinicians prescribe high doses of corticosteroids for a short time at the start of the reaction, usually prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days. However concerns have been raised that they may increase the risk of infection, impair wound healing and other complications, and they have not been proven to have any benefit. They are not effective later in the course of the illness.\n\nCase reports and small patient series have reported benefit from active adjuvant treatments delivered during the first 24–48 hours of illness. As SJS/TEN is a rare condition, controlled trials of therapies in large numbers of patients are difficult.\n\nCiclosporin 3–5 mg/kg/day is reported to reduce mortality by 60% compared to patients with similar SCORTEN score on admission that were not treated with ciclosporin. There are contraindications to treatment such as renal impairment.\n\nOther options include:\n\n- Anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies (eg, infliximab, etanercept)\n- Cyclophosphamide\n- Intravenous immunoglobulin  (IVIG) 2–3 g/kg given over 2–3 days\n- Plasmapheresis\n- Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCS-F).\n\nThalidomide, trialled because of its anti-TNFα effect, increased mortality, and should not be used.\n\n"

As a result, excess cells pile up on the skin surface, causing patches and plaques.\n\nPsoriasis, including scalp psoriasis, is thought to be caused and affected by a combination of genetic, immune, hormonal, and environmental factors, such as:\n\n- Bacterial infections, such as streptococcal sore throats\n- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n- Hormonal changes (psoriasis often intensifies around puberty, the postpartum period, and menopause; and often improves during pregnancy)\n- Sunlight/ultraviolet radiation — usually helps but occasionally exacerbates psoriasis\n- Use of harsh chemical products or soaps\n- Stress\n- Obesity\n- Trauma or injury to the skin (Koebner phenomenon)\n- Cigarette smoking\n- Alcohol consumption\n- Medication — this may induce or exacerbate psoriasis.\n\n"

For example, hair texture that requires a reduced frequency of hair washing thereby renders daily medicated shampoos unsuitable. Once weekly washing in conjunction with daily application of a topical corticosteroid in a vehicle compatible with preferred hair styling practices may be more acceptable.\n\n"

In recent years, a number of new formulations have been developed (eg, foams, shampoos, and sprays) that enhance cosmetic acceptability and adherence. Most treatments will need to be used regularly for several weeks before a benefit is seen, and may have to be applied regularly to keep the scalp clear.\n\nSee Treatment of psoriasis for more information.\n\n"

Compliance can be aided by watching an instructional video on its application and use (see Treating scalp psoriasis linked below).\n- Ketoconazole, ciclopirox, zinc pyrithione, and other antifungal shampoos — effective for dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis; varying effect on sebopsoriasis and psoriasis.\n\n- Intralesional corticosteroids — have been applied in practice and remain a second-line treatment option, although specific studies evaluating this treatment regimen for scalp psoriasis are lacking.\n- Dithranol — a ‘short contact’ cream. Less commonly used now but can produce long remissions. Can cause irritation and staining; avoid in those with grey or blonde hair.\n\n- Targeted phototherapy with a laser or non-laser light source can help improve symptoms.\n- Can be challenging to target the scalp in the presence of hair.\n- Direct treatment may be helped by a handheld ultraviolet B (UVB) comb device.\n\nConsider first-line for patients with scalp psoriasis and accompanying moderate-to-severe whole-body psoriasis; and second-line in other cases where there has been an inadequate response to topical therapy.\n\n- Immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and ciclosporin.\n- Vitamin A derivative acitretin.\n- Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor apremilast.\n- Biologic agents such as anti-TNF, IL-17 and IL-12,-23 inhibitors (eg, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, brodalumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, ustekinumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, and others.\n\nSupport groups can also be helpful for those living with psoriasis.\n\n"

The anthropophilic species T. rubrum is the most common causative agent of tinea corporis worldwide including New Zealand. Other species that may cause tinea corporis include:\n\n- T. interdigitale\n- T. tonsurans — secondary to tinea capitis or skin-to-skin contact\n- M. canis (cats, dogs), and less commonly other zoonotic species including T. verrucosum (cattle), T. equinum (horses) and T. erinacei (hedgehogs).\n\nTinea corporis is spread by the shedding of fungal spores from infected skin. Transmission is facilitated by a warm, moist environment and the sharing of fomites including bedding, towels, and clothing. Dermatophyte infection elsewhere on the skin, such as tinea pedis, can also be transferred. The incubation period is 1–3 weeks. The dermatophyte invades and spreads in the stratum corneum, but is unable to penetrate deeper layers in healthy skin.\n\n"

It is usually caused by T. tonsurans.\n- Tinea imbricata — extensive concentric rings forming polycyclic plaques with thick scale due to T. concentricum. It is particularly itchy. This variant is common in the Pacific Islands and other equatorial tropical areas.\n- Tinea incognito — lacks the typical features of tinea corporis due to suppression of the inflammatory reaction following the topical application of corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Lesions tend to be widespread with poorly defined borders lacking scale and erythema.\n- Majocchi granuloma — a variant involving the hair follicles and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly found on the limbs after shaving. It presents as perifollicular papules or pustules. T. rubrum is the usual organism.\n- Bullous tinea corporis — a rare variant presenting with vesicles or blisters.\n\n"

Fungal culture of the skin scrapings provides identification of the causative organism (see Laboratory tests for fungal infection).\n\nTinea corporis is sometimes diagnosed on skin biopsy, and characteristic histology changes are seen (see Tinea corporis pathology).

BRAF-induced Grover disease may result from keratinocyte proliferation via activation of the MAP-kinase pathway.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated on immunohistochemistry in the sweat gland epithelium and dermal vessels in a patient with COVID-19.\n\n"

A few hairs may also be in catagen. A hair follicle usually grows anagen hair for 4 years or so, then rests for about 4 months. A new anagen hair begins to grow under the resting telogen hair and pushes it out.\n\nThus, it is normal to lose up to about 100 hairs a day on one's comb, brush, in the basin or on the pillow, as a result of the normal scalp hair cycle.\n\nIf there is some shock to the system, as many as 70% of the anagen hairs can be precipitated into telogen, thus reversing the usual ratio. Typical triggers include:\n\n- Childbirth: postpartum hair loss. This can resolve after a few months or transition into female pattern alopecia.\n- Physiological neonatal hair loss\n- Acute or chronic illness, especially if there is fever\n- Surgical operation\n- Accident\n- Psychological stress\n- Weight loss, unusual diet, or nutritional deficiency (eg, iron deficiency/)\n- Certain medications\n- Endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism)\n- Discontinuing the contraceptive pill\n- Overseas travel resulting in jetlag\n- Skin disease affecting the scalp (eg, erythroderma)\n- Excessive sun exposure.\n\n"

        "content": "Telogen effluvium is a non-scarring form of diffuse hair loss with no clinical or histological evidence of inflammation and can affect up to 50% of the scalp hair.\n\nThe resting scalp club hairs remain firmly attached to the hair follicles at first. The new hairs coming up through the scalp push out the resting club hairs and increased hair fall is noticed 2 to 4 months after the triggering event.\n\nThus, paradoxically, with this type of hair loss, hair fall is a sign of hair regrowth.\n\n- As the new hair first comes up through the scalp and pushes out the dead hair, a fine fringe of new hair is often evident along the forehead hairline.\n- At first, the fall of club hairs is profuse and a general thinning of the scalp hair may become evident but after several months a peak is reached and hair fall begins to lessen, gradually tapering back to normal over 6–9 months in most cases.\n- As the hair fall tapers off, the scalp thickens back up to normal, but recovery may be incomplete in some cases.\n\nBecause nail and hair growth are under the same influences, an arrest in hair growth is often mirrored in the nails by a groove across them coinciding with the time of the shock to the system — a Beau line. The time of the shock can be estimated from the fact that a fingernail takes 5 months to grow from the posterior nail fold to the free edge. So if the groove in the nail is halfway down the nail, the shock must have been two and a half months ago.\n\n"

Telogen effluvium does not cause complete baldness, although it may unmask a genetic tendency to genetic balding i.e. female pattern hair loss, or in men, male pattern hair loss.\n\nThe mechanism of chronic telogen effluvium is not well understood. Middle-aged women with a long fluctuating course of telogen effluvium, producing widespread thinning lasting many years have normal hormonal studies.\n\n"

It commonly affects the face (especially eyelids and perioral sites), hands, feet, and genitalia. It may involve tongue, uvula, soft palate, or larynx.\n\nSerum sickness due to blood transfusion and serum sickness-like reactions due to certain drugs cause acute urticaria leaving bruises, fever, swollen lymph glands, joint pain and swelling.\n\nIn chronic inducible urticaria, weals appear about 5 minutes after the stimulus and last a few minutes or up to one hour. Characteristically, weals are:\n\n- Linear in dermographism\n- Tiny in cholinergic urticaria\n- Confined to contact areas in contact urticaria\n- Diffuse in cold urticaria—if large areas of skin are affected, they can lead to fainting (potentially dangerous if swimming in cold water).\n\nThe weals are more persistent in chronic spontaneous urticaria, but each individual lesion will resolve within 24 hours.

It is positive if an injection of the patient's serum under the skin causes a red weal.\n\nInducible urticaria is often confirmed by inducing the reaction eg, scratching the skin in dermographism or applying an ice cube in suspected cold urticaria.\n\nInvestigations for a systemic condition or autoinflammatory disease should be undertaken in urticaria patients with fever, joint or bone pain, and malaise. Patients with angioedema without weals should be asked if they take ACE inhibitor drugs and tested for complement C4; C1-INH levels, function and antibodies; and C1q.\n\nBiopsy of urticaria can be non-specific.

They may be red or white, surrounded by a red or white flare. Weals range in size from a few millimetres to many centimetres in diameter. The shape also varies: round, polycyclic (overlapping circles), annular (ring-shaped), geographic (like a map). They are randomly distributed on the body and may affect any site. They last no more than 24 hours and do not leave any marks behind.\n\n"

Phototherapy works by suppressing DNA synthesis, which in turn reduces inflammation.\n\nNarrowband UVB phototherapy (311–312 nm) is increasingly used compared to broadband UVB phototherapy (270–350 nm). This is because exposure and treatment times are shorter and result in longer periods of remission.\n\n"

For full body treatments, patients are undressed with genitalia covered, and eyes or full face should be protected with goggles or a face mask.\n\nMost patients will have treatment three times a week, at least 24 hours apart. Session length is initially ≤5 minutes, and may be uptitrated as required to a maximum of 30 minutes per session. The number and length of sessions vary for each individual, taking into account their skin type, skin condition, and previous response to treatment.\n\nPhototesting to determine the minimum dose that produces skin redness (MED testing) is recommended and a starting dose of 70% of the MED is often used. The dose is escalated by 20% each treatment, provided there are no side effects or episodes of burning.\n\nTargeted phototherapy devices (eg, excimer laser, brush or comb devices) have also been developed as treatment options for more challenging areas while sparing uninvolved skin.\n\n"

This may be called ‘idiopathic’ urticaria.\n\nChronic urticaria is usually caused by autoimmunity or a chronic underlying infection. It is rare in children.\n\nInducible urticaria is caused by a direct stimulus, such as dermographism, delayed pressure, cold, heat, sunlight, vibration, or exercise.

Dermatitis persists for days to weeks, much longer than urticarial weals.\n- Erythema multiforme — erythematous plaques are usually located on acral sites (the hands, arms, feet, legs, or face). Target lesions (a pattern of concentric rings) are characteristic, sometimes with central blistering. Each plaque persists days to weeks.\n- Urticarial vasculitis — this is uncommon.

Urea 40% aqueous solution can be made up by a pharmacist and has been used for the treatment of black hairy tongues, acne conglobata, and to dissolve and remove diseased nails (medical nail avulsion).\n\nMost urea preparations are available from your pharmacy.

Chlorine reacts with the oxygen atoms in ozone and rips apart the ozone molecule.\n- Over 50% of the ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere has been depleted, leading to the formation of the springtime ‘ozone hole’. During summer, ozone-depleted air from the ozone hole can drift over to South America and New Zealand, resulting in higher levels of UVR than usual for the latitude.\n- Higher winter UVR levels in Australia were seen in the 1990s compared with the 1970s, resulting in predictions that the incidence of UVR-related skin cancer will rise due to depleted ozone levels.\n\nThe ‘Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ was signed in 1987. It is an international environmental agreement to protect the ozone layer by reducing the production and usage of ODSs such as CFCs. Since its initiation, the atmospheric levels of ODSs have significantly decreased and the stratospheric ozone is expected to fully recover by the year 2050.\n\n"

Over time, actinic keratoses appear in the most sun-exposed skin sites; these are tender, red, scaly papules and plaques.\n- Sun-damaged skin is less elastic than skin in other areas and develops a dull yellowish hue due to solar elastosis.\n- Photo-aged skin has more variable pigmentation than other sites due to freckles, solar lentigines, and hypopigmented and scarred areas.

There are more than 150 known HPV types, only some of which infect the skin, giving rise to a variety of clinical presentations. Infection begins in the basal layer of the epidermis, causing proliferation of the keratinocytes (skin cells) and hyperkeratosis, and production of infectious virus particles — the wart. The most common HPV types infecting the skin are types 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 27, 29, and 57.\n\nHPV is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact or autoinoculation; if a wart is scratched or picked, a wart may develop under the fingernail (subungual wart) or virus may be spread to another area of skin. Autoinoculation of the virus in a scratch can result in a line of warts (pseudo-koebnerisation) The incubation period can be as long as twelve months, depending on the amount of virus inoculated.\n\n[see Non-sexually acquired human papillomavirus infection]\n\n"

Cysts may present as a lump, or as painful swelling if the cyst has become infected and an abscess has formed. Bartholin duct cysts are reported to affect 2% of adult women at some time in their life. Skene duct cysts can also present in neonates. Diagnosis is usually made by the anatomic location of the cyst.\n\nMucinous cysts develop from minor vestibular glands found on the inner labia minora along Hart lines. Cysts may be found incidentally, present as a palpable lump noticed by the patient, or cause pain should the cyst become inflamed. Vestibular mucinous cysts typically develop between puberty and the fourth decade.\n\nA cyst of the canal of Nuck is a developmental anomaly due to incomplete closure of the round ligament and is the equivalent of a spermatic cord hydrocele in males. It presents as a skin-coloured, asymptomatic swelling located in the inguinal area and labium majorum, resembling an inguinal hernia. It is usually detected by five years of age.\n\nA Gartner, or mesonephric, cyst develops in remnants of an incompletely regressed mesonephric duct. The mesonephric duct forms the male sexual organs, so should regress completely in the female fetus. Persistent mesonephric duct remnants in a female are usually associated with congenital abnormalities of the metanephric urinary system such as an ectopic ureter, unilateral renal agenesis or hypoplasia. A Gartner cyst is a small solitary unilateral cyst on the front vaginal wall towards one side, which may bulge to present as an interlabial mass in late adolescence.\n\nAt the ninth week of gestation, the paramesonephric duct develops into the fallopian tube. Remnants of this duct can form a ciliated, or paramesonephric, cyst found incidentally on the labium majorum during pregnancy, puberty, or with other hormonal influences. The lesion is usually a single cyst cavity, 1–3 cm in diameter, and drains clear or amber-coloured fluid if ruptured.\n\n"

        "content": "Vitiligo is due to the loss or destruction of melanocytes (melanin-producing cells).\n\nGenetic factors appear to contribute to 80% of vitiligo risk, whilst environmental factors account for 20%. Many genetic loci have been identified, all related to the immune system, except for TYR which encodes tyrosinase, a key enzyme in melanin production and a major autoantigen in vitiligo.\n\nThe convergence or integrated theory combines immunological, biochemical, oxidative, and environmental mechanisms that work jointly in those with a genetic susceptibility is widely accepted.\n\nThis could be explained through three phases:\n\n- Initial phase: less adhesive melanocytes are prone to internal and external oxidative stresses, leading to the production of more toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n- Progression phase: an imbalance between ROS and antioxidants will activate the adaptive immune system bridged by the innate immune system.\n\nCD8+ cytotoxic cells release cytokines, mainly interferon-γ (INF-γ) that activate the JAK-STAT pathway through its receptors on keratinocytes. This will lead to the production of chemokines (CXC), predominantly by keratinocytes, but also by melanocytes themselves, leading to IFN-γ–CXCR3- CXCL9/10 axis loop feedback.\nActing together on their common CXCR3 receptor, CXCL9 drives the main bulk of CD8+ cell homing, while CXCL10 promotes their localisation to affected skin lesions and induction of melanocyte apoptosis through CXC3B activation. Of note, where both humoral (antibody) and T-cell responses appear to be implicated, antibody titres do not correlate with disease activity nor the localisation of distinct vitiligo lesions.\n- CD8+ cytotoxic cells release cytokines, mainly interferon-γ (INF-γ) that activate the JAK-STAT pathway through its receptors on keratinocytes.

These TRM cells may be responsible for what is called an ‘autoimmune memory’, in which relapses occur mostly at the same exact site of previous lesions.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular pathogenesis of vitiligo serves as a promising source for the development of more targeted therapies.\n\n"

When successful re-pigmentation occurs, melanocyte stem cells (DOPA-negative) in the middle and lower outer root sheath (ORS), or bulge at the base of the hair follicle are activated (become larger, with intense DOPA oxidase activity). They migrate to the skin surface to form pigment islands, appearing as perifollicular brown macules. Otherwise, re-pigmentation can occur in less common patterns such as marginal, diffuse, or combined.\n\nTreatment response is evaluated in terms of proportion of skin that has retained pigment. In studies, a good response is usually translated as > 50% or 75%, depending on the study’s design.\n\n"

Body vitiligo showed less dramatic response.\n- Other controversial therapies include pseudocatalase and topical prostaglandin inhibitors\n\nFurther studies are needed to confirm efficacy.\n- Further studies are needed to confirm efficacy.\n\nPhototherapy refers to treatment with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Options include:\n\n- Whole-body or localised UVB phototherapy\n- Excimer laser UVB (308 nm) or targeted UVB for small areas of vitiligo\n- Oral, topical, or bathwater photochemotherapy (PUVA)\n- In-office or home phototherapy.\n\nPhototherapy probably works in vitiligo by two mechanisms.\n\n- Immune suppression — preventing the destruction of the melanocytes\n- Stimulation of cytokines (growth factors).\n\nTreatment is usually given twice weekly for a trial period of 3–4 months. If re-pigmentation is observed, treatment is continued until re-pigmentation is complete or for a maximum of 1–2 years.\n\n- Phototherapy is unsuitable for very fair-skinned people.\n- The treatment intensity aims for the vitiligo skin to be a light \"carnation\" pink.\n- If re-pigmentation is observed, treatment is continued until re-pigmentation is complete or for a maximum of 1–2 years.\n- It is essential to avoid burning (red, blistered, peeling, itchy or painful skin), as this could cause the vitiligo to get worse.\n\nA meta-analysis of 35 different studies reporting outcomes after phototherapy for generalised vitiligo. A marked or clinically useful response was achieved in 36% after 12 months of narrowband UVB and in 62% after 12 months of PUVA. The face and neck responded better than the trunk, which responded better than the extremities. It was not very effective on the hands and feet.\n\n- Systemic steroids\n\nShort pulse therapy to slow rapid progression, or as mini-pulse oral steroids to stabilize active disease, eg, dexamethasone 2.5–4 mg, for two consecutive days per week, for 3–6 months.\n- Short pulse therapy to slow rapid progression, or as mini-pulse oral steroids to stabilize active disease, eg, dexamethasone 2.5–4 mg, for two consecutive days per week, for 3–6 months.\n- Methotrexate\n- Ciclosporin\n- Mycophenolate mofetil\n- Oral minocycline 100 mg/day, a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties\n- Subcutaneous afamelanotide\n\nAn α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) analogue.

Showed superior re-pigmentation when combined with NB-UVB, but excessive tanning in unaffected surrounding skin made final cosmetic results less satisfying.\n\nNone of these treatments are based on randomised controlled trial data.\n\nSurgical treatment for stable and segmental vitiligo requires removal of the top layer of vitiligo skin (by shaving, dermabrasion, sandpapering, or laser) and replacement with pigmented skin removed from another site.\n\nTechniques include:\n\n- Non-cultured melanocyte-keratinocyte cell suspension transplantation\n- Punch grafting (mini-grafting)\n- Blister grafts, formed by suction or cryotherapy\n- Split skin grafting\n- Cultured autografts of melanocytes grown in tissue culture.\n\nDepigmentation therapy, using 20% monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone (MBEH), may be considered in severely affected, dark-skinned individuals with vitiligo that has failed to re-pigment spontaneously or with therapy.\n\nCryotherapy and laser treatment (eg, 755-nm Q-switched alexandrite or 694 nm Q-switched ruby) have also been used successfully to depigment small areas of vitiligo.\n\nOther novel potential therapies that are still under research include those targeting IFN-γ–JAK–STAT1 pathway (targeting CXCL9/10), anti-IL15 and anti-CD122 (targeting TRM), Wnt signalling antagonists, and others.\n\nVitiligo results in reduced quality of life and psychological difficulties in many patients, with problems like depression and poor self-esteem, especially in adolescents and in females. Patients should be assured that there is always something on the table to help in managing their condition, from using camouflage to available therapies with possible measurable improvement. The psychosocial impacts of vitiligo tend to be more severe in some countries, cultures, and religions than in others.\n\nFamily support, counselling, and cognitive behavioural treatment can be of benefit.\n\n"

This usually starts as brown spots arising around the hair follicles (perifollicular), usually darker than the normal skin colour, where the overall size of the white patch may get smaller.\n- Vitiligo can extend further, either by the appearance of new spots, or by peripheral enlargement of pre-existing ones.\n- Cycles of pigment loss followed by periods of stability may continue indefinitely.\n- Poor prognostic indicators include longstanding disease, leukotrichia, mucosal involvement, and Koebner phenomenon.\n\nClick here for images of vitiligo\n\n"

More widespread vesicular eruptions can also be due to enterovirus\n- Papular acrodermatitis of childhood (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) most often caused by Epstein-Barr Virus or hepatitis B\n- Laterothoracic exanthem (asymmetric periflexural exanthem of childhood or APEC), cause uncertain but many viruses implicated in case reports\n- COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)\n- Haemorrhagic fevers caused by togavirus, bunyavirus, and arenavirus are potentially fatal, with bleeding into the skin\n- Smallpox, a deadly disease hopefully now eradicated by widespread vaccination\n- Cowpox\n- Monkeypox, a newly emerged pox virus present in the Congo\n- Chikungunya fever, dengue, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and zika fever (due to arboviruses).\n- Other haemorrhagic fevers include Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (nairovirus), Lassa fever (arenavirus), Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and Marburg haemorrhagic fever (filovirus).\n- Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a genetic disorder with a predisposition to unique cutaneous human papillomavirus types and skin cancer.\n- Various skin complaints are more common with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections (AIDS) including acute human immunodeficiency virus infection syndrome  and Kaposi sarcoma (which is due to infection with herpesvirus 8)\n- Rickettsial diseases are due to organisms classified between bacteria and viruses\n- Yellow fever is a serious flavivirus infection characterised by yellow skin and eyes due to jaundice.\n\nViral infections can also cause cancer. Examples include:\n\n- Human papillomavirus-associated penile, vulval, and oral intraepithelial neoplasia, vulval and oral cancer, epidermodysplasia verruciformis\n- Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\nLocalised skin and mucosal conditions caused by viral infections include:\n\n- Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum, herpetic whitlow\n- Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome\n- Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\n- Molluscum contagiosum\n- Viral warts (verrucas, anogenital warts or condylomas and squamous cell papillomas)\n- Orf\n- Milker's nodules\n- Oral hairy leukoplakia.\n\nIn the future, we expect to classify more skin conditions as viral in origin as more sophisticated tests for viral particles become available.\n\nViral infections including viral hepatitis sometimes give rise to:\n\n- Erythema multiforme\n- Erythema nodosum\n- Kawasaki disease.\n\n"

Sometimes a complete vulvectomy (removal of the vulva) is undertaken because of the extent of disease or because of multifocal uVIN/HSIL. Excision is also undertaken for dVIN, which is rarely multifocal but can be more aggressive than uVIN/HSIL.\n\nIf invasive cancer is not suspected, laser ablation may be used in some centres. Like surgical excision, it is performed under general anaesthetic.\n\nMedical therapy is reported to be effective in at least some cases of uVIN/HSIL, and is useful for treating a field area prone to multifocal disease. Options include:\n\n- Imiquimod cream, applied 3 times weekly for 12 to 20 weeks. This results in red, inflamed, and eroded tissue and is often accompanied by considerable discomfort.\n- 5-fluorouracil cream, applied twice daily for several weeks. This causes quite severe inflammation for several weeks, and will not be tolerated by all women. It is less effective than imiquimod cream and thus is used less frequently than in the past.\n- Photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires specialised equipment and can also be very painful.\n- Therapeutic HPV vaccination.\n- Cidovir has been described to be useful in some patients.\n\nNone of these medical treatments are officially approved for uVIN/HSIL and they are rarely recommended for dVIN.\n\nUnfortunately uVIN/HSIL recurs in up to half of of patients after treatment. This is more likely if:\n\n- The patient is immunosuppressed\n- The lesion was incompletely removed (positive margins may have been reported by the pathologist)\n- Disease is multifocal.\n\nLichen sclerosus associated with dVIN is also a risk factor for recurrence.\n\n"

The lamp is held about 10-30 cm away from the skin. The examination is painless and safe.\n\nA Wood lamp is used to identify the extent of pigmented or depigmented patches and to detect fluorescence. Normal healthy skin is slightly blue but shows white spots where there is thickened skin, yellow where it is oily, and purple spots where it is dehydrated. Clothing lint often shines bright white.\n\nA positive result is reported if a pigmentary disorder is more noticeable when examined using the Wood lamp or if fluorescence is noted.\n\n"

Wounds break the continuity of the skin and allow organisms to gain access to tissues and cause infection.\n\nInfections arising in surgical wounds are one of the most common hospital-acquired infections and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality.

Antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated for clean-contaminated wounds and is usually recommended for contaminated wounds. Antibiotics for dirty wounds are part of the treatment because the infection is already established. When deciding on a prophylactic antibiotic consider the following:\n\n- Use an antibiotic based on likely bacteria to cause infection\n- An antibiotic should have good tissue penetration to reach wound involved\n- Timing and duration of antibiotic – it is important that therapeutic concentrations are reached at the time of the incision, throughout the surgical procedure and ideally a few hours postoperatively.\n\nWound infection can complicate illness, cause anxiety, increase patient discomfort and lead to death. It is estimated that surgical wound infections result in an increased length of hospital stay by about 7–10 days.

        "content": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner). Warfarin-induced skin necrosis refers to a rare condition in which there is paradoxical blood clotting. Blood clots block the blood vessels and cause necrosis, where an area of skin is destroyed. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis affects one in every 10,000 patients prescribed warfarin.\n\nThe onset is usually within the first 2 to 5 days of warfarin therapy when the blood tends to clot more than is normal. Skin necrosis affects areas of the body with a high fat content.\n\nWarfarin can also give rise to calciphylaxis, a form of cutaneous necrosis due to occlusion of blood vessels with calcium.\n\n"

It is more common in obese patients and perimenopausal women.\n\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is more likely if warfarin is given without heparin or if a higher loading dose of warfarin is given in the first day or two of treatment.\n\nVery rarely, warfarin-induced skin necrosis occurs weeks or months after starting warfarin therapy. This may occur in the following circumstances:\n\n- the dose of warfarin has been increased\n- prescribed doses have not been taken\n- liver disease\n- drug interactions.\n\nCalciphylaxis is more often seen in the setting of chronic renal failure but may be rarely caused by warfarin when kidney function is normal.\n\n"

        "content": "Warfarin is a widely used anticoagulant or blood-thinner. It works by inactivating vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. At the same time, Vitamin K dependent proteins C and S are inactivated – these are natural anticoagulants.\n\nHalf the activated Protein C disappears within 6 hours (its half-life). So, Protein C runs out during the first few days of warfarin therapy, before Factor X and II disappear, which have half-lives of 2-5 days. In some circumstances, this leads to excessive clotting.\n\nWhy the skin necrosis happens in the areas of fat abundance is unclear; possibly these areas are more susceptible because of reduced blood supply.\n\nWarfarin-induced calciphylaxis may be due to inhibition of the matrix protein Gla, which normally prevents calcium deposition in the blood vessels.\n\n"

Sometimes Vitamin K is used to hasten the reversal of warfarin effects. If there is life-threatening coagulation then protein C concentrates can be used.\n\nOnce warfarin is stopped small areas of skin necrosis can be left to heal, but larger areas of skin necrosis may require surgery and skin grafting.\n\nWarfarin has been cautiously restarted in lower doses in some patients when needed for long-term anticoagulation. This is best done with advice from a haematologist.\n\n"
